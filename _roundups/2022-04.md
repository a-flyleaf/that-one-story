More stuff and things. Features sketch-notes sparked by [the walk cycle animation]({%include url.html%}/gallery/walkin).

## linkage

- "I showed you my <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-showed-you-my-dick-please-respond" class="ext">[meme]</a> pls respond"
- "now listen to me, i am linking directly to <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/green-mm-bambi-copypasta" class="ext">the copypasta</a> now,"
- "Pathos Trophy" comic is in [the December roundup]({%include url.html%}/gallery/roundups/2021-12)
- Didn't really use <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/misslunarose/art/Touching-Meme-blank-829516168" class="ext">these prompts</a> but there's a link anyway
