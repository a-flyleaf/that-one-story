## from the description
> So Anyway That Colorscript. I wanted to finish it 100%\* by the end of the month (\*well, start to finish; I *know* there are scenes I’ve skimmed or even skipped along the way, wanna fill those in too). July is <a href="https://a-flyleaf.github.io/artfight/" class="ext">ArtFight</a> season and I figured that’d be a good opportunity to set aside the thing for a few weeks, then review it in full with fresh eyes later. And so, as of yesterday [June 29, 2022], it is done! I feel like I had more to say about that but just saving the file gave me a minor heart attack, like it’s almost my turn at a recital or something. Nerves like that are a big reason why I want to give it a fresh-eye review before publishing anything… <span style="display:inline-block;">:,y</span>
