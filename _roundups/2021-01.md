At this point I was actually bothering to separate story doodles from other art, so the top part of this image has been cropped off. This separation lasts approximately 1.25 more roundups before they turn into an unorganized conglomeration.

I was also fairly judicious about what actually made it *to* the roundups, compared to the end of the year. Other previously-unposted stuff from this month will be thrown down here eventually maybe.

## from the description
> [U]ntitled new story was supposed to be a random little throwaway concept back in November, because that’s always a fun creative exercise and I wanted to indulge some of my favorite narrative tropes. Except I made the “mistake” of revisiting it this month, and it is quickly getting out of hand <span style="display:inline-block;">:^D</span> I don’t plan on Making Anything with it, but it’s for that exact reason I’m posting all the doodles so flagrantly, so maybe you will see these guys around more.
