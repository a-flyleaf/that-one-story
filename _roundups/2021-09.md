Features sketches that would eventually be used for [an expression dump]({%include url.html%}/gallery/expressions), quick sketches of [people with bats]({%include url.html%}/gallery/batta), and [a toothy smile]({%include url.html%}/gallery/hello). Also cropped completely seamlessly: [a menagerie]({%include url.html%}/gallery/menagerie).
