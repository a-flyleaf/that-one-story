lorem ipsum short descriptions go here. did [a buncha headshots back in August](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/bam-more-headshots-890359582) but the last one is *definitely* outdated. everyone has a Token Color™ or two and that is the most important thing.

In order of introduction, more or less. Select to read <span class="spoiler">spoiler text</span>.

I'm hoping the characterizations speak for themselves, so I'm noting things that wouldn't be noticeable from the synopses, core motivations, and where they end up.

## Joce
6\'1\", 24 (nearly 25).
- Twitchy. Speaks quickly, often stutters. Mildly to severely disheveled.
- Dull yellow (looks green), later warm brown.
- Has constant background thoughts of impending disaster. Not as stoic as she tries to be.
- Just wants to live. If she can be a decent person while she's at it, even better.
- Endgame: <span class="spoiler">Commits metaphorical suicide to escape an otherwise-inescapable spiral. Stays true to her vow but avoids further personal entanglement.</span>

## Kay Lin
4\'3\", early 20s (but looks much younger).
- More lively than initial impressions suggest. A bit of a tease. Rarely far away.
- Purple, saturation varies; occasionally shown with yellow/gold irises (debatably diegetic).
- All too familiar with this place. More obvious about some things than she wants to be.
- <span class="spoiler">Wants to self-destruct, basically; barring that, craves purpose and/or company.</span>
- Endgame: <span class="spoiler">Is denied all of the above, and left to move on without. Since this follows a harsh wake-up call, it's a welcome change.</span>

## Addison
5\'5\", 20-ish.
- Smiles through gritted teeth. Poise is performative. More expressive when agitated.
- Orange, usually bright; yellow-green accents.
- Wants to make a name for herself. For grandiose reasons, obviously.
- Endgame: <span class="spoiler">"Killed" by her own foolhardiness and trapped rotting in indecision. Later provoked into staying; killed by the rabbit she promoted.</span>

## Caleb
4\'0\", apparently 18 or older.
- Constantly anxious. Often nervous, sometimes righteously furious. Concerningly attached.
- Pink, the more pastel the better.
- Wants to get stronger. <span class="spoiler">The real arrogance was inside him all along.</span>
- Endgame: <span class="spoiler">Finally overpowers someone bigger and tougher than him; murdered by the second-most underestimated player. Accepts death and fades.</span>

## Gary
5\'7.5\", 19.
- Gregarious, loud, has some kinda American accent. Grand gestures, simple motives.
- Deep reddish-brown. Complete heterochromia.
- Wants to have a good time--and make sure his pals are having one, too.
- Endgame: <span class="spoiler">Encourages the reading of a very bad letter; attacked by rabbits and "killed" by a cave-in. Left semi-lucid and pleads for release.</span>


## "The accountant"
\>6\'6\", 30s.
- Prominent accent. Speaks quickly but distinctly. Minimal non-hand gesturing.
- Aqua, blue-green, whatever you call the midtone.
- <span class="spoiler">Wants to discern why people destroy themselves. Why would anyone be so knowingly stupid?</span>
- Endgame: <span class="spoiler">Mortally wounds Kay Lin after sentimental answers are deemed insufficient, then knocked out. Remains underground on purpose.</span>

## Sequitur
6\'1\" (but often severely slouching), 20s.
- Suuuuuuuuper slow, tends to drag out sounds. Often sounds "stoned." Awkward motions.
- Indigo, hypersaturated or near-gray. It's faded.
- Doesn't really want much of anything. Isn't sure how they got here, but i's whatever, y'feel?
- Endgame: <span class="spoiler">Passivity is nearly taken advantage of. Later declares intentions to leave, and last seen nonchalantly standing in a rabbit's maw.</span>

## "White Rabbit"
5\'11\", 20s.
- Silent. Often seen slinging a bat over one shoulder. Most expressive via charades.
- Pale blue-gray-yellow.
- <span class="spoiler">Wants to stay here forever. Dreads the consequences of leaving.</span>
- Endgame: <span class="spoiler">Forced to admit she can't make anyone *else* stay without destroying them. Last seen threatening her last friend; <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">"Don't go."</em></span>

## other recurring

### "the fallen"
The game's first casualty. Wears a necklace. <span class="spoiler">Joce recognizes them in the first rabbit that attacks her and Kay Lin.</span>

### Joce's housemates
Two people who tend to annoy Joce with their usual couple antics. One is more thoughtful than the other. <span class="spoiler">This one befriends Joce over the end montage.</span>

### "Wolf"
One of two masked "deputies" Addison keeps close; nicknamed for the plastic knockoff wolf mask worn 24/7. Hot-headed, assertive, and outgoing. <span class="spoiler">After Addison's death, they take over the alliance, but meet their demise to rabbits at some point offscreen.</span> Probably jealous of White Rabbit in some way.

<span style="font-size:.75em;">\*idk gender lol</span>

### "nameless"
A competitor who looks vaguely similar to Kay Lin. Quiet and unassuming.

### Salvador Skoal Flores
aka <i>Sal</i>, the writer of the letter Joce receives alongside the game invitation. <span class="spoiler">Joce's ex (implicit fiancé), who apparently hasn't gotten over her.</span>

### [unnamed medic]
An alliance loyalist. Joce befriends them\* later. \[basically just here to put a face on Joce's increased familiarity with her new allies. might meet up irl in the end montage?]

<span style="font-size:.75em;">\*neutral "they"? undecided-gender "they"? we shall see</span>

Bonus factoid: Despite names being a bit of a Theme here, it's more thematically-relevant that a name is *known* (or not) than what the name actually *is*. (By which I mean, if any of these monikers are ~meaningful~ it is a total coincidence. *Finding names that Sound Right is a struggle as-is okay,,*)
