lorem ipsum short descriptions go here. did [a buncha headshots back in August](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/bam-more-headshots-890359582) but the last one is *definitely* outdated. everyone has a Token Color™ or two and that is the most important thing.

In order of introduction, more or less. Select to read <span class="spoiler">spoiler text</span>.

## Joce
6\'1\", 24 (nearly 25).
- just wants to live/survive (in a world where she is implicitly not supposed to do that, on a semi-figurative level)
- lonely as fuck
- I don't actually know what else to write here, story should speak for itself :Vc main color? other Identifying Details, design changes, stuff that wouldn't make it to notes?? idk ART.

## Kay Lin
4\'3\", early 20s (but looks much younger).

## Addison
5\'5\", 20-ish.

## Caleb
4\'0\", apparently 18 or older.

## Gary
5\'7.5\", 19.

## "The accountant"
\>6\'6\", 30s.

## Sequitur
6\'1\" (but often slouching), 20s.

## "White Rabbit"
5\'11\", 20s.

## other recurring

### "the fallen"
The game's first casualty. Wears a necklace. <span class="spoiler">Joce recognizes them in the first rabbit that attacks her and Kay Lin.</span>

### Joce's housemates
Two people who tend to annoy Joce with their usual couple antics. One is more thoughtful than the other. <span class="spoiler">This one befriends Joce over the end montage.</span>

### "Wolf"
One of two masked "deputies" Addison keeps close; nicknamed for the plastic knockoff wolf mask worn 24/7. Hot-headed, assertive, and outgoing. <span class="spoiler">After Addison's death, they take over the alliance, but meet their demise to rabbits at some point offscreen.</span> Probably jealous of White Rabbit in some way.

<span style="font-size:.75em;">\*idk gender lol</span>

### "nameless"
A competitor who looks vaguely similar to Kay Lin. Quiet and unassuming.

### Salvador Skoal Flores
aka <i>Sal</i>, the writer of the letter Joce receives alongside the game invitation. <span class="spoiler">Joce's ex (implicit fiancé), who apparently hasn't gotten over her.</span>

### [unnamed medic]
An alliance loyalist. Joce befriends them\* later. \[basically just here to put a face on Joce's increased familiarity with her new allies. might meet up irl in the end montage?]

<span style="font-size:.75em;">\*neutral "they"? undecided-gender "they"? we shall see</span>

Bonus factoid: Despite names being a bit of a Theme here, it's more thematically-relevant that a name is *known* (or not) than what the name actually *is*. (By which I mean, if any of these monikers are ~meaningful~ it is a total coincidence. *Finding names that Sound Right is a struggle as-is okay,,*)
