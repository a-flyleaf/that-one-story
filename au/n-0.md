# something masquerading as a postscript
That's it. That's the end.

Now, I *could* say <a href="https://www.owleyes.org/text/lady-tiger/read/lady-tiger" class="ext">the point of the story is this</a>: Did Joce seek the established wrongdoer or an uncertain escape? And to be clear, this was never meant to have a decisive, gift-wrapped ending.

<figure><img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/au/note.png" alt="Screenshot of a document, reading as follows: […]lines get fuzzy. Also, I don’t actually think I want J+[redacted] to meet; maybe it’s a “Lady and the Tiger” thing, where the end is something of a cliffhanger/copout hinging on the question: Does Joce go in? Or, hm, I forget the original story but I think it was more “what’s behind the curtain.” So when/if Joce opens the door, what does she find?">
<figcaption><span class="x">Above: </span>Snippet from my initial brainstorming notes; transcription in the alt text.</figcaption></figure>

But if the point of the story wasn't to bring a narrative to a clean close, then what *was* it?

For me, a few things. Primarily, an excuse to mess around (as if that's an activity that necessitates an excuse). I thought it might be a good experiment with medium, something between prose/script and image-only comicking, with image captions visible throughout. In this regard I think it was pretty successful, and I'm strongly considering using it to convey, y'know, The Main Canonical Story.

It has also been an inadvertent exercise in Actually Finishing Something, satisfaction with the end product be damned.

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Plaintext note documenting the days I’ve worked on this thing, starting in October, going through November and December, and finally concluding on January 10.</figcaption></figure>

I first conceived the story in mid-September, thinking it'd be fun to have weekly installments through October. A handful of prose-based false starts later, actual page construction (and mixed-media drafting) began past the first week of October, and then the first update ([splash](splash), [index](index), parts [viii](viii)+[vii](vii)) actually went live <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/it-s-november-937575364" class="ext">in mid-November</a>. At that point I had enough "backlog" to update again <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/my-neighbor-vamptoro-idk-i-ve-never-seen-that-movi-938333073" class="ext">a week later</a> ([vi](vi)+[v](v)), and then I was S.O.Bl. (Shit Outta Backlog), came back <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/quality-content-right-on-time-941220998" class="ext">in December</a> with the tortured spirals of [iv](iv) (written fully in advance, only needed minor tweaks) and [v](v) (A Struggle™). I write this nearly two weeks into January.

So, uh, not all according to <i title="means “plan”">keikaku</i><span class="x"> (means “plan”)</span>. But it *is* done. Which is pretty new for me, far as storytelling that exceeds its initial scope\* and self-imposed deadlines is concerned. (\*To think I was originally only gonna have 1--2 pages per part, *L.O.L.*) Don't mind me patting myself on the back a bit, here.

Anyway. Self-absorption aside. What's been in this for *you*?

Man, hell if I know. Insert flippant-sounding(-but-fueled-by-genuine-sentiment) handwave about how what readers take away from a story isn't necessarily what the author intends, so it's presumptuous of me to assume you're getting *anything* out of this.

But you're still reading, which has gotta count for something. So here's a few bonus factoids, from me to you, as a gift and thanks for being here:

- What good is an officially-penned offshoot if it's *not* gratuitously teasing at canon?
- That said, some of this is just because changing the entire setting and context and everything tends to change how characters behave. Particularly the vampires, because, well, *vampires.*
- If we took a glimpse into what reshaped the characters you've seen here, a cast list might look something like this: <b style="text-transform:uppercase;">Starring...</b>
	- <b>Joce</b> as herself, combining "default" and pre-story phases;
	- <b>Kay Lin</b> as herself, with an unhealthy sprinkling of endgame;
	- <b>Addison</b> as herself, but in a more constantly-distressing situation than canon tends to put her in;
	- <b>Caleb</b> as himself, but if he was locked in a tower for several thousand years;
	- <b>Gary</b> as Gary;
	- "The accountant" as "<b>the hunter</b>," with some impulse control shaved off and a newfound interest in the supernatural;
	- <b>Sequitur</b> as themself, with a bit less self-preservation (but the bar isn't high);
	- "White Rabbit"(’s fully-human version) as <b>the driver (first to die)</b>, with relevance severely nuked because to have a larger hand in the plot would have hinted at too much; and
	- the nameless enigma as the <b>beckoning vampire</b> as the same is the one and only, but now with more violence.

Make of all that what you will~!

...Of course, if you're not interested in this crew's canon at all, it's likely none of this is particularly rewarding.

That said, before you go: can I offer you [a colorscript]({%include url.html%}/story/colorscript) (for canon! for real! ~~even though it's already a little outdated!!~~) in this decidedly-not-vampiric time?

Thanks for reading~ <span style="display:inline-block;">:></span>
