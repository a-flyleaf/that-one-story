"What is *with* you and that girl, anyway?"

"And, yeah, maybe my tone was a little harsh. It took a while for Joce to answer. And when she did, she had this whole spiel:

"They'd only just met, her and the girl, Ka... Katelyn, whatever she's called, if that's even her real name. The *vampire* hadn't hurt us, didn't even ambush Joce or anything. (Which, true, but, low bar?) While Joce was searching the vamp-girl followed and just... made small talk, apparently, told her about the place, but nothing useful.

"Then they heard something, and whatshername left to make sure 'the other one wasn't causing trouble.' And I'm like, '*Which* other one,' and Joce has no clue. That's why she followed, Joce did, and they both barged in.

"Does that make sense? I feel like I'm not making sense.

"Not like anything has, since we got there. Joce was---I guess she'd been looking for a key? I thought she'd ditched me, that's what the other guy said, the one who got stabbed to ash. I told Joce she better not leave me behind again. She gave me a funny look, stammered something like 'I didn't--- You'd said---'. That's all.

And I'm thinking, am I going crazy? Am I being double-gaslit? Does it even matter anymore?

"Where the hell even *were* we? Joce asked if I'd found anything, and I don't even know what she's talking about, and I'm not gonna lie, I started getting upset. Why am *I* getting interrogated, y'know? How did we get here? All I know is that I read some stupid book and it said mortals couldn't last here, and the fang boy said the same thing, and maybe they're both lying but I didn't even want to tell her what happens to the bodies, that was too much.

"That's around when you showed up. I think. But it might've been a trick of the shadows, because you didn't reply when I said anything. (And if it *was* you, that was pretty rude.)

"At least I forgot what I was upset about. But the other one hadn't; I could still hear yelling from downstairs, someone banging on a door. I thought maybe I should check that out, maybe try to calm them down.

"That's coherent, isn't it?"

"I don't think I've been *all there* since we stepped in here, is the thing.

"Anyway. You didn't have to be so startled to see me. I just thought maybe you should quiet down, maybe take a nap. I asked, who even *was* this letter-writer castle-head person-vampire, which must've been one of the crazy moments because you obviously have no relation.

"No, wait---*you* found it, but it was *for* Joce, and--- Well, I guess it doesn't matter, since everyone jumped on the bandwagon to follow it back to the mystery sender. Joce said *she* knew who it was, and they hadn't spoken in years, but not much else. That's what happened. I'm *certain* that's what happened. I *saw* it, and I didn't *want* to go, but---

"Look. This sounds stupid, but... you're half the reason I agreed to this. I mean, I wanted to get out, too, but I didn't want to *trespass*---and that was *before* we found out why the woods are off-limits.

"The person I was with, at one point, said the letter-writer is dead, or supposed to be, which I guess confirms yet another goddamn vampire, but when I heard that, I thought it meant *you* had a chance, you and everyone else.
