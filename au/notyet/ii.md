<!--
- intro bit: KL stabs something with one of Caleb’s fangs. “Dear diary,” she mumbles aloud, “today I got stabbed.” Turns out she’s carving out a tally, the fang dissolving like soft chalk. There’s banging elsewhere; zoom out to show a KL vs C tally, implying they’ve “killed” each other lots before. “I’ve been very good today, all things considered. I think I can just lock myself down here forever, and then no one else gets hurt—” *CRASH.* …Welp, better go check that out.
- Basically gonna shuffle the context of the pro/con list a bit, maaaybe add a preceding bit (after an hr on the intro page?) where she walks up, sees the mess (just show her reaction), mutters “Ohh, so *that’s* what happens… / Ah, shit, I said that out loud. Uhh. Hi…?”. From there she starts trying to convince Joce to let her (KL) turn her (J), and cue the procon thing.
- At the end, actually show KL stabbing herself (with *what* idk; maybe Joce grabs herself a “stake” from a rotting plank, and somehow KL grabs it?). Points to her fang, “Your key,” and collapses, dead.
- No interlude? Next part opens with a parallel flashback to Joce standing over Sal’s body; sparse narration, something like *I shouldn’t have let myself go that far*? IDK but it’s a swift and quiet end from there.
