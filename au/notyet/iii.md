"What? Wasn't he bothering you?"

"What is *wrong* with you?!"

Kay Lin doesn't get it. Addison went with the little plan just now, didn't she? (*What* plan?) She kept Caleb's attention (he was *already* fixated!), then Kay Lin snuck in (yeah, and Addison would've gotten away *sooner* if *a certain someone* hadn't been standing around like a goddamn---), and look, he didn't see it coming, bam. Done. ("*Done?!*")

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Addision still sputtering. Kay Linâ€™s hands are up again halfheartedly; she rolls her eyes.</figcaption></figure>

Oh, *that's* reassuring!

"What is *with* you and that girl, anyway."

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Joce forges ahead, Addison close behind. [silhouettes? get some of those escher vibes in the scenery]</figcaption></figure>

Joce only met Kay Lin tonight, same as anyone. But no one had seen Kay Lin *do* anything until just now---and even if this *is* a trap, she hasn't hurt them. She didn't interfere while Joce was searching the place, and only strayed to see if "the other one" was causing trouble. And okay, no, she didn't specify *which* "other one," but that's why Joce followed her.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Addison has a headache. [just her, maybe a dialogue bubble overhead, out of focus. she looks tired.]</figcaption></figure>

Through what's felt like hours of searching, all Joce has turned up are dusty rooms, stairs weaving through halls tucked under arches. There was one conspicuous door further down, immovable. She's looking for a key, now. The locks here are strange....

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x400.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>The castle is labyrinthian. Onward drags the night.</figcaption></figure>

"...S-so." For once it falls on Joce to speak. "F-find any---anything, yourself." It's probably supposed to be a question.

Well. Funny she should ask.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Addison says something to Joce. [off-center, small.]</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Joce steps back. Addison canâ€™t offer much. [silhouettes?]</figcaption></figure>

<figcaption><span class="block"><span class="x">Image: </span>Joce takes off down the stairs.</span> <span class="block">Addison watches for a moment.</span></figcaption></figure>

The vampire said it. The book said it before him. And Addison didn't want to believe it, but Joce sure as hell seems to. They're really not gonna last the night, are they? <!--on a fresh-eyes reread this does not have the impact I was hoping, needs revision. we've already said they're gonna die here but it needs Oomph at this particular junction. like... How. what happens, exactly. do we just explicitly drop that they turn, or Strongly Hint At It??-->

She feels drained. All this, and for what? Wither away in this cursed castle or get mauled by a monster outside. She couldn't bring herself to say what happens, if the sources are true, to the bodies. <!--I like this bit tho, specifically the "wither or maul" bit and the hint at something Bad happening to the bodies. hm, maybe something like "to their minds, never mind the bodies...."-->

Gary had a bit of a point, at least. Might as well get some answers.

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>In no rush, Addison descends to follow.</figcaption></figure>

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Joce is banging at the door, yelling.</figcaption></figure>

Some sick death trap this is, huh? Somehow Joce doesn't seem tired in the slightest. Would their friend, the only one they all knew, have been this defiant?

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/> <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Addison approaches, weary. She puts a hand on Joceâ€™s shoulder. <i>Enough.</i></figcaption></figure>

Maybe they should just save their energy. Wait until day breaks, the sky clears. Ha, maybe when they wake up it'll all have been some nightmare, wouldn't that be---

"Stop. You s---You sound like---"

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Joce, frustrated, gives the door a final slam.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x150.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>It echoes, hollow.</figcaption></figure>

How does Joce even *know* this... letter-writer castle-head person-vampire, anyway? It's a glimmer of old snark, and Addison wants to think that's what gets Joce to listen, and not some kind of pity.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>[???idk they step back or smthn, maybe Addison stumbles a bit. or maybe focus on one of them, or neither, downshot, idek]</figcaption></figure>

It's... someone she knew. *(Well, yeah.)* They're not in touch, anymore. *(Right, that was implied...)* But it's not *just* that, they were more than just estranged, it's...

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Flashback: Joce held the letter, Gary and the <span style="display:inline-block;">first-gone</span> friend looking over her shoulders.</figcaption></figure>

"S-supposed to be. To be dead."

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>This gets Addisonâ€™s attention. [small still, maybe? off-center. woozy.]</figcaption></figure>

*Dead.* Dead, but back. Like a vampire, maybe, sure. But there's a certainty in Joce's voice, like she *knows* that person didn't come back, not before. And it makes Addison wonder--- Is there a chance...?<!--not sold on the transition but EGHH-->

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Hazy. Thereâ€™s a rabbit in the distance.</figcaption></figure>

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Addisonâ€™s face lights up.</figcaption></figure>

She calls out.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>And suddenly sheâ€™s caught, falling into strong arms.</figcaption></figure>

It's been a long night, hasn't it?

"Let's go home."

[that's it, JUST that image. end part.]

<!--also if we're hinting at the dead turning then KL can just like. jump in here and stab her, or something. make sure she Stays Dead. usually vampires don't let it get this far. bonus points if the pose, rather than A just Lying There, suggests Something Awful Was Happening.-->
