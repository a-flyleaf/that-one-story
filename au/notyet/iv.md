<!--additions/thoughts from last night:
- gary got dragged through the gate and it also broke open and no one is surprised. i think. i don't want to draw a bunch of new things showing this but It Did Happen, allude to it maybe, or have caleb watching /that/ instead (but hmm then why her...)
- joce doesn't just ditch addison, she's looking for a key! and addison is Tired:tm:. joce was basically like "look i get it i am also exhausted but like, i'm gonna go search, and whether you stay close or not is up to you." (far as addison's concerned she got ditched anyway, though.)
- at the end: KL throws something at Caleb? then goes in for the kill. I nuked their powers so this has just gotta be straight-up physical assault lmao, bonus points if she stabs him with something (that she later uses on herself)
- either here or next part: "I just want to go home, fall asleep, and when I wake up this will all have been some nightmare."

<i><span>From the moment I saw you</span> <span>I knew you were mine.</span></i>

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Earlier, Addison held the stick to Kay Linâ€™s back as the group trudged through the castle grounds. Someone was watching. <i>How interesting.</i> [all one img?]</figcaption></figure>

You looked terrible. I didn't care.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x400.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>The castle door opens; enter Kay Lin, followed closely by a very disheveled Joce and Addison. The narrator watches from above.</figcaption></figure>

I suppose that would've been off-putting to some. Your attitude was no charmer either, from a relentless nag <i>(from start to bitter end, you'd tell me)</i> to cowardice <i>(trying to stop him---and for what?)</i> to sheer terror <i>(of course it surprised you all, you don't mess with weres)</i>, and all for what? So you could enter, shivering, the place you least wanted to be, just as reluctantly as you'd been since the beginning? Not an admirable picture. Barely even respectable. <!--WHAT is he talking about. rewrite this-->

But to me, it made you human.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>People are talking. Only Addison is in focus.</figcaption></figure>

It made you perfect.

<span class="dlg">"Don't."</span>

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Kay Lin talks to the narrator, away from the others.<!--don't forget the gash on her shirt--></figcaption></figure>

It's funny, that she tried to "warn" me. What did she think I was going to do to you? I meant no harm, I could have ended both of you the moment you stepped in, you knew that. *She* knew that.

But she didn't care. She thought she was better than me---always did, always will. It's my favorite delusion.

<span class="dlg">"I brought them here for shelter,"</span> she said. <span class="dlg">"That is *it*. Don't be weird about it."</span>

For how long, I asked; overnight, she said.

"They'll be lucky if they last an hour." I said this sadly as I could muster. "You're kidding yourself if you think otherwise."

<span class="dlg">"One got invited."</span>

"And the other?"

She couldn't reply to that. Of course she couldn't. We both knew.

"Don't tell me what to do, Kay Lin." I flashed her a smile. "I'll take care of her."

You must forgive me for being smug. I&nbsp;haven't had the opportunity for so long.... She thinks she's better because she goes outside, likes to tell herself she can resist our nature. But I know what I am, and I don't *impose* it on people.

If someone comes by, fine. But I won't seek them out. I won't. I can't.

I know how it ends.

----

It didn't take long for the other visitor to abandon you, did it? Kay Lin played favorites too, of course she did, and I might have laughed at the blatant hypocrisy (it wouldn't have surprised me if she'd buckled already), but they left *you* and that was so very sad. <!--edit as noted? /Caleb/ suggests abandonment, Addison's like "well. to be fair,,"-->

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Addison sits alone by a dim fireplace. The narrator approaches.</figcaption></figure>

Were you crying? I couldn't tell. And when I asked if you were okay, you greeted me as follows, so elegantly:

<span class="dlg">"Oh, great. There are two of them."</span>

I couldn't imagine being so openly flawed!<!--is this caleb?? is this caleb????? being openly flawed is kind of his whole schtick. just tweak the wording, this is supposed to be in a similar vein as the opening bit: "your personality actively repulses me but like, as soon as i saw you bossing kl around i wsa sold lmao. you are pitiful, let me outdo that"-->

But... you paid attention to me. I'm weak.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>The narrator sits at her side.</figcaption></figure>

I don't remember exactly what I said, but it wasn't much. I couldn't blame you for your distaste---how could I, knowing who you'd met first? No, I must have been validating, saying your fears made sense.

And at that slight nudge your frustrations just spilled out. It was as though I wasn't there at all; you needed someone to hear, and I happened to be there, and no one else. I'm happy to have been that person. Maybe you would like me more for it.<!--...?? it's. it's Fine ig but could be rephrased-->

You told me how you'd barely wanted to go to "that stupid party" in the first place, but anyone who meant anything was going to be there, so you had to. You told me how you fell in with a smaller group, with one person you kinda-knew and a few others, and that when they found the letter they held a vote, and you were the only one who said no, even the hesitant recipient wanted this, and you felt so very stupid. So you had to join, you *had* to, just to be there.

It seemed trivial back then. You had no idea what was at stake.

You had no idea you were going to watch not one but *two* companions get torn limb from limb.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>[similar to the last one? Caleb has moved slightly closer.]</figcaption></figure>

You mumbled something about yet another, this one missing, that <span class="dlg">"Your *friend* there probably has something to do with it, and now I'm blabbing everything to you like an idiot...."</span> You told yourself you were going to keep them in line. What a night, huh?

In short: you were vulnerable. And I had to take the chance.

I took your hand. (You were unsettled and pulled away. It made me sad. You looked sorry.) I told you the truth: Yes, we really are vampires, and tonight we hunger more than ever. That you, or anyone else besides the invited, are here, was never meant to be.

This place will kill you. Even if you buried us in the walls and drove stakes through our hearts, you will die here, because no mortal can withstand...

Well. I'm not sure myself. It's a latent energy, a terrible energy, and it will drain you to the core. If I could stop it, I would.

Why do you think we're so lonely?

<hr id="short">

But there's a catch to everything, isn't there. Here, I told you, is ours: this castle will not *let* you leave, as a mortal. Only a vampire can open its doors. And there's a way to allow both this *and* guarantee your survival:

"Let me," I said, "turn you."

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>The narrator looks closely at Addison as he says this.</figcaption></figure>

And you were tired. You were drained. A long night of nonsense you never thought possible, only to find out an even *more* inexplicable circumstance would mean you'd never live to see the other end.... It was too much to process.

I almost had you.

<span class="dlg">I. *almost.* had. you.</span>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="block"><span class="x">Image: </span>In a foreground silhouette, Addison backs away.<!--caleb's an unreliable narrator; he makes it seem like he wsa This close, maybe addison was (byh her own admission?) too tired to protest, but she /did/ back off. kl was like "owo i hear protest?"--></span> <span class="block">Beyond them both, Kay Lin appears in the doorway.</span></figcaption></figure>

I was honest. I was good to you. I barely got to tell you everything I'd already come to admire about you, what I imagined for us in our future eternity. We'd be friends. You'd never have to worry about being out of step again, or losing your friends, because it'd just be us, and *<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">I'd</span>* be yours, and I'm not going anywhere. Not for long. I promise.

We

were

so

close.

I hope you'll come back for me.
