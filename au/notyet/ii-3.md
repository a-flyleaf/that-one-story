- At the end, actually show KL stabbing herself (with *what* idk; maybe Joce grabs herself a ‚Äústake‚Äù from a rotting plank, and somehow KL grabs it?). Points to her fang, ‚ÄúYour key,‚Äù and collapses, dead.
- No interlude? Next part opens with a parallel flashback to Joce standing over Sal‚Äôs body; sparse narration, something like *I shouldn‚Äôt have let myself go that far*? IDK but it‚Äôs a swift and quiet end from there.

I...

I understand, now.

She's already been exposed. It must be a sort of... if not immunity, a defense, which is why she hasn't succumbed yet.

She's going to lose her mind in here. She'd... *rather* lose her mind in here, than let me lay a finger on her. Even if that's her only hope of getting out of here, unless....

"Y-your key... one use..." <!--don't like this but W/E IT WORKS she's actively dying (~"dying") and can't say much anyway-->

<!--this is gonna be flat but I'm gonna churn it out anyway AUGH--> And whether you go to the one who tricked you or get out of here, I hope when I come back, I don't see you again. <!--also one more image?--> It'd hurt too much.
