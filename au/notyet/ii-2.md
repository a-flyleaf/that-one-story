blabbin from last night
- intro bit: KL stabs something with one of Caleb’s fangs. “Dear diary,” she mumbles aloud, “today I got stabbed.” Turns out she’s carving out a tally, the fang dissolving like soft chalk. There’s banging elsewhere; zoom out to show a KL vs C tally, implying they’ve “killed” each other lots before. “I’ve been very good today, all things considered. I think I can just lock myself down here forever, and then no one else gets hurt—” *CRASH.* …Welp, better go check that out.
- Basically gonna shuffle the context of the pro/con list a bit, maaaybe add a preceding bit (after an hr on the intro page?) where she walks up, sees the mess (just show her reaction), mutters “Ohh, so *that’s* what happens… / Ah, shit, I said that out loud. Uhh. Hi…?”. From there she starts trying to convince Joce to let her (KL) turn her (J), and cue the procon thing.
- At the end, actually show KL stabbing herself (with *what* idk; maybe Joce grabs herself a “stake” from a rotting plank, and somehow KL grabs it?). Points to her fang, “Your key,” and collapses, dead.
- No interlude? Next part opens with a parallel flashback to Joce standing over Sal’s body; sparse narration, something like *I shouldn’t have let myself go that far*? IDK but it’s a swift and quiet end from there.

<h2><span>Pros and Cons</span> <span>of Biting Joce</span></h2>

<span class="procon">Pro</span>: I’m fucking starving.

<span class="procon">Con</span>: Sequitur.

<span class="procon">Pro</span>: That’s only because they resisted. If Joce cooperates it won’t happen again.

<span class="procon">Con</span>: She doesn’t even want to hear you speak.

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>[KL talking to/following Joce?? idk I gotta work out the visuals better]</figcaption></figure>

<span class="procon">Pro</span>: I’ve been so good, though. I deserve it.

<span class="procon">Con</span>: You haven’t *earned* it.

<span class="procon">Pro</span>: It doesn’t have to be much. Little nip, world’s smallest bite. If I can hold out ’til morning maybe I won’t want to devour her anymore.

<span class="procon">Con</span>: You’ll have to watch her wither away.

<span class="procon">Pro</span>: Then wouldn’t I be doing her a favor? I didn’t *make* her come this far, she knew it was risky. She’s already suffered enough.

<span class="procon">Con</span>: Christ, you sound like Caleb.

<span class="procon">Pro</span>: If I satisfy myself my judgment won’t be so impaired.

<span class="procon">Con</span>: You knew it was a bad idea to come out tonight in the first place.

<span class="procon">Pro</span>: Then it’s too late for me anyway.

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>[KL meeting Joce??]</figcaption></figure>

-: You like her.

+: We only just met. It can’t be a *huge* betrayal.

-: You just met and you’re attached enough to be having this conflict at all.

+: Okay, so, it’s a *me problem*. I’m sorry I’m miserable and lonely and wanted *one* night out? How was *I* supposed to know, when I panicked and *deliberately removed myself* from the party before I lost it, that she’d *also* be out there like a fucking loser? Hell, the fact we hit it up so well is a point *towards* turning her, because then we’d get to keep, y’know, *getting along* together, and not being stuck on the sidelines, like we apparently always are—

-: She wouldn’t want that.

+: I almost don’t care.

<i>What are you, some kind of psychopath? Leave her alone.</i>

I’m hungry. I’m so, *so* hungry. Even if I walk away I’m going to hear her running around in here, like she has any chance of escaping like this, and then what? At least this way, everything we’ve been through will actually amount to something.

<i>You’re going to get staked.</i>

Ha, I can imagine… she finally turns around and stabs me to shut me up. Or I get her to “submit,” and the moment I let my guard down—! Heh, god, I hope she does.<!--see I know exactly what I was going for but idk about the progrsesion; "submit"? add a /little/ more to the sentence where she cuts herself off? and like, in general, maybe tone down the "lmao hope I die," keep it. ~~subtler-->

<i>You’re depraved.</i>

And wicked, too.

But… mm, I can’t just give myself to her.<!--yeah see this part. that's a Bit,--> I’d come back, and she’d be gone, and it’d all be sad and futile. I still have self-control, here.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>[aaaaa]</figcaption></figure>

I wish she would just listen to me. I don’t *want* to hurt her. I don’t *want* to watch her slowly die. I don’t know how she’s lasted as long as she has, and I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up.

I’m so close. *She’s right there.* I can’t take it—

[img: Joce turns around. (Joce has had Enough.)]

Please. *Please.* Let me turn you. <!--hmm different phrasing? still parallels Caleb but not so explicitly-->

[img: Joce rips off her scarf. / Kay Lin is speechless.]

…

*Ah.*


<!-- idk what to do with this, might be parts I wanna salvage when reviewing with fresher eyes

You know, I've tried to be good, I really, truly have. If I spent *one* more second in this empty abyss of a castle I would've lost my fucking marbles. It's not *my* fault the other two would rather wither away for centuries than go *out* sometimes! Hell, I didn't even know one of them *existed* until tonight.

'Oh, Kay&nbsp;Lin, you mustn't subject the mortals to your corrosive presence, for it's only a matter of time before you' blablabla I *get* it. I do! I don't have the world's best self-control either, I know, but at least I *try*. And I think I'm getting better, even if we're just counting tonight. I've had so many opportunities to just... be *worse,* and I didn't, and we've made it all the way here and it's not even my fault most of them died.

I mean. I *guess* I could've said something, about this place being radioactive, or whatever. Maybe I was being a little selfish pointing you this way, because I was *hurting* and not exactly thinking clearly.

But, what, would you prefer I just... never showed up at all?

Then you'd all be rabbit bait. You wouldn't even know to come here. Or if you *had* made it, then I'd *really* be starving, and we wouldn't even get to say hello.

I did you a favor. So I think the *least* you can do is pay it back?

----

Look, I'm not some creep like Caleb. If I agreed with him I wouldn't have, y'know, *killed him*, to get him out of your faces for a while. I know you're sad and desperate or whatever, and I don't want to take advantage of you.

I actually *like* you. It makes *me* sad to watch you dig around like there's some hidden key to get out of here; there's not, I'm telling you, and I never *wanted* it to come to this. I don't know how you've survived this long, but if you make it to morning, it's not gonna mean anything; the doors don't magically unlock when the sun rises.

You *need* my help. I'm telling you to *take it*, while I can still *<span class="procon">Con</span>:trol it*. It's not that hard.

----

I don't even think you'd *mind* being a vampire, is the funny thing. So what if we never find out if the castle head is real or not? You already don't fit in with humans.

No offense. But come *on*, how long had you been out on the back porch alone when I found you? The whole time? I mean, the party was driving me batty too (haha, *batty,* now you get it---I don't shapeshift, though, promise), but my excuse was that if I kept having to be around people I might've gone feral or whatever. You just got locked out.

...Okay, that was low, sorry. I don't think anyone did that to you on *purpose*, if it makes you feel any better. But---look, my point is, outcast buddies? Y'know, you, me, eternity in this--- Alright, I *know* I've been making it sound pretty miserable, but I swear it's---

...

...Huh?

Oh, you *know* I'm not gonna shut up now, right? (I mean, I'd guess you don't mind it *too* much, since you haven't attacked me yet or anything. Or maybe you're just waiting to backstab me, ha.) But hey, no, listen, you can't backpedal on this--- "Heard it before," that's not about me, is it.

[asdksdgkhssdfjs ok I don't think she'd be saying ALL this out loud is the thing. KL's not That talkative. maybe more like... filling in the "missing" scenes a bit, BRIEFLY? meeting, during the addison/gary arguing, way later just now (while caleb talks to addison), and NOW here we are.

that said this part has been bugging me for days and I'm just gonna leave this here & plow through the last part. writing is hard]

THROUGHLINE: "I want this but I shouldn't," whether "it" is going out and Making Friends or attacking said 'friends' and now what to do about Joce being stuck and doomed here. yay

wonder if we can squish it all into like, 3-ish "parts" maximum... probably few to no pictures for a change\*, not necessarily all monologued but safe to assume *some* is said aloud, ends with revelation that Joce has been bitten and KL's like "oh. oh, *shit*" and goes off to nuke herself/leave Joce the "key."

\*this part's important because the finale is *no* text, other than image captions. hmm, we kinda lose Joce's motivations this way; maybe some of the blank-filling can have her like, talking about that herself? idk, it's sorta ooc but everyone's character is being stretched here....
