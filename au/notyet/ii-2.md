<!--
- At the end, actually show KL stabbing herself (with *what* idk; maybe Joce grabs herself a “stake” from a rotting plank, and somehow KL grabs it?). Points to her fang, “Your key,” and collapses, dead.
- No interlude? Next part opens with a parallel flashback to Joce standing over Sal’s body; sparse narration, something like *I shouldn’t have let myself go that far*? IDK but it’s a swift and quiet end from there.

## <span>Pros and Cons</span> <span>of Biting Joce</span>

<span class="procon">Pro</span>: I’m fucking starving.

<span class="procon">Con</span>: Sequitur.

<span class="procon">Pro</span>: That’s only because they resisted. If Joce cooperates it won’t happen again.

<span class="procon">Con</span>: She doesn’t even want to hear you speak.

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>[KL talking to/following Joce?? idk I gotta work out the visuals better]</figcaption></figure>

<span class="procon">Pro</span>: But I've been holding back so long. I deserve it.

<span class="procon">Con</span>: You haven’t *earned* it.

<span class="procon">Pro</span>: It doesn’t have to be much. Little nip, world’s smallest bite. If I can hold out ’til morning maybe I won’t want to devour her anymore.

<span class="procon">Con</span>: You’ll have to watch her wither away.

<span class="procon">Pro</span>: Then wouldn’t I be doing her a favor? I didn’t *make* her come this far, she knew it was risky. She’s already suffered enough. It's only a matter of time...

<span class="procon">Con</span>: Christ, you sound like Caleb.

<span class="procon">Pro</span>: If I satisfy myself my judgment won’t be so impaired.

<span class="procon">Con</span>: You knew it was a bad idea to come out tonight, full stop.

<span class="procon">Pro</span>: Then it’s too late for me anyway.

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>[KL meeting Joce??]</figcaption></figure>

-: You like her.

+: We only just met. It can’t be a *huge* betrayal.

-: You just met and you’re attached enough to be having this conflict at all.

+: Okay, so, it’s a *me problem*. I’m sorry I’m miserable and lonely and wanted *one* night out? How was *I* supposed to know, when I panicked and *deliberately removed myself* from the party before I lost it, that she’d *also* be out there like a fucking loser? Hell, the fact we hit it up so well is a point *towards* turning her, because then we’d get to keep, y’know, *getting along* together, and not being stuck on the sidelines, like we apparently always are—

-: She wouldn’t want that.

+: I almost don’t care.

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>[moar stalking... idk what visuals here, maybe like, Uncomfortable Detail Closeup somewhere? don't show either of their faces; either KL POV or make it somehow otherwise clear (shadows? reflections??) that she's following]</figcaption></figure>

<i>What are you, some kind of psychopath? Leave her alone.</i>

I’m hungry. I’m so, *so* hungry. Even if I walk away I’m going to hear her running around in here, like she has any chance of escaping like this, and then what? At least this way, everything we’ve been through will actually amount to something.

<i>You’re going to get staked.</i>

Wouldn't that be something? She finally turns around and shuts me up for good; I mean, she didn't grab that metal shard for nothing. I don't know what's stopping her. Maybe she'll pretend to go along, but as soon as I let my guard down---!

Hah. Just take me behind the shed, already.

<i>You’re depraved.</i>

And wicked, too.

But… ahh, see, that's just selfish. I’d come back, and she’d be gone, and it’d all be sad and futile.

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>[aaaaa]</figcaption></figure>

I wish she would just listen to me. I don’t *want* to hurt her. I don’t *want* to watch her slowly die. I don’t know how she’s lasted as long as she has, and I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up.

I’m so close. *She’s right there.* I---

Listen I've tried to be good if I'd spent one more second locked in here tonight I would've gone insane I've been trying so hard it's not my fault the others died do you hear me it's not if I hadn't been out you'd all have been rabbit bait I did you a *favor* I don't want to take advantage of you I didn't want it to come to this I'm offering help while I still can I can only control myself so much please just take it please just do this for me what do you *mean* you've heard it all before---
