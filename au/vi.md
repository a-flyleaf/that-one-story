Vampires are fascinating creatures. Indiscernible and often derived from everyday humans, they sequester themselves from civilization lest they be staked; to intermingle with us openly is suicide, just as a human encroaching one of their domains will meet our maker by dawn.

And yet our paths cross. The vampire, of course, is possessed monthly with insatiable "bloodlust," akin more to a lethal starvation than sensual deprivation---though those with romantic inclinations would be forgiven for conflating the two. Perhaps it's projection on humanity's part; what are we if not possessed by curiosity, a call alluring as it is damning? Easier to blame it on those whose spells we fall under.

The twist, of course, is that vampires, being otherwise human, are condemned by the same urges. Case in point: tonight I witnessed an execution, and pitiful was the killer.

Full moon on Hallow's Eve is a nigh-obscene alignment of circumstance. Such auspicious conditions bring out both the specialized and foolhardy, and so it was little surprise to find a group of lost youth lost in the northwoods. As with others of their acuity they were likely tempted out by the childish urge to witness something supernatural (unlike us *certified* hunters, who do the same but with additional preparation). (For documentation's sake, it bears mentioning I caught wind of a "letter," apparently interpreted as a lure. However, such schemes, orchestrated by fellow humans, are common.)

Typically I would pay little mind to such gatherings. After some arguing (they appeared to be lost) one wandered off, then another, and there was a peculiar *intent* with the latter that caught my attention. In elaboration I offer the paltry "gut feeling," a sense honed from years of observation.

The first stray wandered far of their own volition. Patent suicide, all considered; the second "human" wasted no time following, unnoticed by the rest. Banter made clear there was no trace of suspicion on behalf of the human---until, at least, the vampire made herself clear.

Reports of vampires disguising themselves among the populace, at least for a brief hunt, are nothing new. What stuck out was this one's decision to stick to a smaller group; surely this would negate the ability to disappear in a crowd? And typically, vampires are *not* forward until their victim has no say in the matter.

But surely *this* was premature?

Far as I'm aware, a vampire requesting "consent" is undocumented. Do note the quotes---some claim vampires possess a type of hypnotism, which I'd previously dismissed as the fantasy of novelists, but this human, and I must stress, *<u>did</u> <u>not</u> <u>move</u>.* A freeze response, perhaps? disbelief? The shock *seemed* genuine, much as they attempted to laugh it off.

The vampire claimed cooperation could prevent fatality; news to me if true. The unwitting guinea pig never said "yes"---or "no," for that matter, and lie back (the height differential, I should mention, was severe) with what I have to assume was some reluctance.

Though my vantage was obscured, here I *believe* I caught another oddity:

so That Happened and in the end i had an Encounter but it was kind of a mess. and then it ended. i could not be more deliberately vague about this if i tried. anyway bye]

<!--The final writings of a vampire hunter: While searching the woods (going directly to the castle would of course be fatal), the hunter witnessed a vampire asking a human for permission to feed, and the human "consenting." This, unsurprisingly, killed the human; expository tangent about vampiric bloodlust. The hunter speaks vaguely of encountering the vampire firsthand, and leaves the end vague.-->
