Vampires are fascinating creatures. [fucking love vamps my dude, they're like normal humans in almost every way except fucked up. namely they have Bloodlust and something something teeth are we even keeping that plot point, if we are then make sure it's visible in the seq part.

insert sketch of teeth or w/e

anyway saw one asking for feeding permission which was p wack. human was like "uhhh. Sure" but it's not like they had any real say in the matter, rip in fuck. you see vampires have bloodlust and oh yeah the house thing don't forget to mention going straight to the source is fatal was around the perimeter etc etc

so That Happened and in the end i had an Encounter but it was kind of a mess. and then it ended. i could not be more deliberately vague about this if i tried. anyway bye]

<!--The final writings of a vampire hunter: While searching the woods (going directly to the castle would of course be fatal), the hunter witnessed a vampire asking a human for permission to feed, and the human "consenting." This, unsurprisingly, killed the human; expository tangent about vampiric bloodlust. The hunter speaks vaguely of encountering the vampire firsthand, and leaves the end vague.-->
