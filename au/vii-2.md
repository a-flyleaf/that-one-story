"You good?"

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Sequitur jumps. But itâ€™s just Kay Lin.</figcaption></figure>

"We're dead. But, ehh." Sequitur shrugs. "<span class="x">I</span>â€™m good."

<span class="block">Seems to amuse her.</span> <span class="block"><i>Might as well shoot the shit.</i></span>

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Sequitur sits down on a log, staring out into the abyss. As prompted, Kay&nbsp;Lin joins them, and talks:</figcaption></figure>

"You're pretty chill for someone who thinks we're gonna die."

"Eh, worryin's pointless."

Not like Kay Lin seems fussed, either.

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span><span class="block">Sequitur, questioning, points at her.</span> <span class="block">Not like they can read her expression.</span> <br/></figcaption></figure>

"It's been... fun."

"That a joke?"

"Never been in a car crash before."

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Sequiturâ€™s amused.</figcaption></figure>

Yeah, night's just full of surprises, ain't it? Could'a been vampires.

Kay Lin doesn't respond. Sequitur is reminded that they haven't seen her around much before tonight.

Must be new here!

<figure><img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/au/7-18.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Cue Sequitur infodump. They gesture around Kay&nbsp;Lin without really paying attention to her.</figcaption></figure>

Vampires, supposedly, live in the castle the group was (is?) headed towards; that was the goal, to see if it's really abandoned. Not everyone believes the stories, but they're a hell of a deal; there's "vamp-hunters" around and everything.

Far as Sequitur's concerned, mind, it's all rumors. Then again, they would've said the same about the rabbits.

At least the vampires are human. Kind of.

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Sequitur is mildly concerned.</figcaption></figure>

Kay Lin seems distant.

"Better human than monster... right."

Mhm.

Idly Sequitur wonders if anyone's noticed either of them are gone. How long *has* it been, anyway...?

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Kay Lin grabs their arm.</figcaption></figure>

<i>Skin's cold.</i>

"Say, Sequitur..."

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Sequitur is sweating. Kay Lin stares at them closely.</figcaption></figure>

Aw, who're they kidding. They're dead meat out here.

"Could you... do me a favor?"
