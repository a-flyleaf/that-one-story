Next update will be the last.

Seeing as I am fresh out of art backlog I&nbsp;don't have a panel teaser this round. Have a little process-thing since I saved a bunch of layers of this one panel for some reason.

<figure><img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/au/process.png" alt=""/><figcaption>[Image description: Process shots of the panel in which Addison yells at (an offscreen) Kay Lin, with one hand on Joce nearby. Started by blocking out both figures; refined Joce & added the doorway frame; refined Addison; sketched both faces (noted: ‚Äú*I usually don‚Äôt do sketches on these but the faces were giving me issues here in particular‚Äù); and made finishing tweaks (drew both faces, readjsted frame & Addison‚Äôs pointer finger, and added gradients for contrast).]</figcaption></figure>
