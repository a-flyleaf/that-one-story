<i>Meanwhile, a panicked run's distance from the crash site....</i>

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Cloudy night. A distant structure overlooks a gnarled forest.</figcaption></figure>

"We shouldn't even *be* out here."

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Of five frazzled people, two are arguing.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/au/7-03.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>One of the arguers, Gary, gestures boldly in one direction. From eye level, all they can see is trees.</figcaption></figure>

Right, Gary insists, but it's too late to turn back. It only makes sense to keep going---

<figure><img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/au/7-04.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>The other arguer, Addison, isnâ€™t having it.</figcaption></figure>

It's not too late at all, Addison protests. They should turn around before they get too far, and---

Counters Gary, they're *already* too far! They can't go back *towards* the things that tried to kill them. At least if they try for the castle, the trip will have been worthwhile---

Argues Addison: Not worth their lives!

<figure><img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/au/7-05.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>As the argument continues, the other three are on uneasy standby. Two, Joce and Kay&nbsp;Lin, mumble amongst themselves.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/au/7-06.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption>Which leaves Sequitur.</figcaption></figure>

The disagreement shows no sign of stopping. And it's too risky to split up.

Thus concludes Sequitur: <i>Welp.</i>

<figure><img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/au/7-07.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>And with that, they walk away.</figcaption></figure>

<i>Man, who would'a thought a fuckin' Halloween party would'a went this way.</i>

<i>Sucks.</i>

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Theyâ€™re being watched.</figcaption></figure>

"You good?"

<figcaption><span class="block"><span class="x">Image: </span>Sequitur jumps.</span> <span class="block">But, recognizing the speaker, they calm down.</span>[two panels, copypaste?]</figcaption></figure>

"We're dead. But, ehh." Shrug. "<span class="x">I</span>â€™m good."

Seems to amuse her.

<i>Might as well shoot the shit.</i>

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Sequitur slumps down on a log, staring out into the abyss. As prompted, Kay&nbsp;Lin joins them, and talks:</figcaption></figure>

"You're pretty chill for someone who thinks we're gonna die."

"Eh, worryin's pointless."

Not like Kay Lin seems fussed, either.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span><span class="block">Sequitur, questioning, points at her.</span> <span class="block">Itâ€™s too dark to read her expression.</span> <br/>[silhouette, side view?]</figcaption></figure>

"It's been... fun."

"That a joke?"

"Never been in a car crash before."

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Sequiturâ€™s amused.</figcaption></figure>

Yeah, night's just full of surprises, ain't it? Could'a been vampires.

Kay Lin doesn't respond. Sequitur is reminded that they haven't seen her around much before tonight.

Must be new here!

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Cue Sequitur infodump. They gesture around Kay&nbsp;Lin without really paying attention to her.</figcaption></figure>

Vampires, supposedly, live in the castle the group was (is?) headed towards; that was the goal, to see if it's really abandoned. Not everyone believes the stories, but they're a hell of a deal; there's "vamp-hunters" around and everything.

Far as Sequitur's concerned, mind, it's all rumors. Then again, they would've said the same about the rabbits.

At least the vampires are human. Kind of.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Kay Lin is quiet.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Sequitur is mildly concerned. [small "?"]</figcaption></figure>

Kay Lin seems distant.

"Better human than monster... right."

Mhm.

Idly Sequitur wonders if anyone's noticed either of them are gone. How long *has* it been, anyway...?

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x150.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>They start to get up. [speech bubble?]</figcaption></figure>

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Kay Lin grabs their arm.</figcaption></figure>

<i>Skin's cold.</i>

"Say, Sequitur..."

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Sequitur is sweating. Kay Lin stares at them closely.</figcaption></figure>

Aw, who're they kidding. They're dead meat out here.

"Could you... do me a favor?"
