# Sequitur

"We shouldn't even *be* out here."

{Image: A cloudy night; a distant castle overlooks a gnarled forest. Of five frazzled people, two argue.}

"And? We are now." That's Gary, and he replies all nonchalant but even he's shook up by the crash. "Might as well keep going."

We've been out here, what, few minutes, barely caught our breath, and he and Addison are already feudin' again. Joce all agitated, her friend whatshername watchin' everyone.... An' me, well. I just wanna zone out.

"We are *not,*" Addison again, "going *towards* the looming castle of doom."

"So? It's not like we can see anywhere *else* from here," says Gary. "Unless you *want* to get lost---?"

"We already are!"

Yeah, a'ight. I ain't listenin' to this.

{Image: The speaker, Sequitur, wanders off alone.}

Man, who would'a thought a fuckin' Halloween party would'a went this way. First the invite then the rab... *whatever* those were, were-things, guess the rumors weren't kiddin'. So much for stickin' together as a team; pretty sure we're all only here cuz'a one person, and guess who got dragged straight out the driver's seat?

Sucks.

{Image: Sequitur's being watched.}

"You good?"

*Shit* who th--- Oh, that one. Joce's lil' friend, whatshername. Never seen her before tonight. Uh. Hi.

"We're dead," I say. "But eh." Shrug. "I'm good."

Seems to amuse ’er, I'll take it. Only a matter of time til some new abomination pops up outta nowhere; might as well shoot the shit these last few minutes, yeah?

{Image: Sequitur slumps down on a log, staring out into the abyss.}

Guess she's not here to drag me back, cuz she sits down next to me. Curious. "You're pretty chill for someone who thinks we're gonna die."

*Thinks?* Tryin'a make me feel better, maybe. "Eh," I say, "worryin's pointless." Plus, "You don't seem too fussed, either," and I ain't kiddin', because even when I jab a finger in her direction she doesn't quit starin' at me.

"It's been... fun."

Pfft. "That a joke?"

"Never been in a car crash before."

Heh, alright, I'll give ’er that one. "First time for everythin', right?" I throw in a friendly elbow jab, for good measure. "Let's see, first rabid bunnies, what's next... maybe if we're lucky the vamps'll get us instead."

"'Vampsill'?"

"Y'know. Vampires," I say, figure she ain't from around here, "they could get us, s'posedly. Buncha local stories ’bout that, say they used to live in the castle over thataways." Can't miss it, even out here; I point it out behind us no problem. (Oh yeah, north-ish, where the others are. Anyone notice we're missing...?) "Thought it was all rumors, but then, rabbits."

"Oh. Haha, yeah, maybe." She looks away, finally, maybe nervous or sum'n. "You'd rather die by vampire than were-rabbit?"

"Shoot, I dunno. Least vamps are human-ish, accordin' to 'hunters.' Vampire hunters, I mean," I add, and I'm gonna let her decide whether I believe in 'em. Crazy-ass nomads givin' up their whole lives chasin' bloodsuckers. Guess they're not too different than us, though, drivin' out to no-man's-land after a letter, and who'm I to judge a weirdo....

Girl seems distant, lost in some kinda thought. Oh yeah, I should explain the 'hunter' commen---"Better human than monster," she mumbles, "right."

...Yeah, I'unno what that's about. Eh, I been there in zoneout land, I get it.

Unless it's nerves? Shit, yeah, maybe she's afraid of vampires, did not think of that. (Goddamn, where *is* everyone? Me, I get, but no one's lookin' for her? Not even Joce?)

"Hey," I say, "if they're human then you could reason with ’em, maybe. Tell ’em to go suck on someone their own size." Heh. "Say your blood's poisoned. Oh, or maybe---"

"Say, Sequitur," she says, like she didn't hear a word (eh, fair ’nuff, been blocked out beore). And now she's lookin' at me again, and ohh, *that's* why it was kinda wiggin' me out---I feel like prey. Dumb, dumb instinct, probably just that we were talkin' about monsters ’n' shit--- "Could you... do me a favor?"

Where the sweet unliving *hell* are the others.
