"We shouldn't even *be* out here."

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>A cloudy night; a distant castle overlooks a gnarled forest. Of five frazzled people, two argue.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>One of the arguers, Gary, tries to be nonchalant. The castle, though still far, is in sight.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>The other, Addison, isn't having it.</figcaption></figure>

It only makes sense, argues Gary, to proceed; they've come so far.

But, Addison insists, they're already further out than they should be. They should turn around and try to find their way home.

Counters Gary: they're lost either way, aren't they? At least his way means they're getting something out of it.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>As the argument continues, the other three are on uneasy standby. Two, Joce and Kay&nbsp;Lin, mumble amongst themselves.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption>Which leaves Sequitur.</figcaption></figure>

Splitting, of course, would be suicide.

Thus concludes Sequitur: <i>Welp.</i>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>And with that, they walk away.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>[top part of image is dark/fades in, or add margin] The woods engulf them.</figcaption></figure>

<i>Man, who would'a thought a fuckin' Halloween party would'a went this way.</i>

<i>First the invite, then the rab... *whatever* those were.</i>

<figcaption><p><span class="x">Image: </span>Monsters attacked the truck.</p><p>The driver got dragged out the window.</p></figcaption></figure>

<i>...</i>

<i>Sucks.</i>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Theyâ€™re being watched.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span><i>Kay Lin.</i></figcaption></figure>

"You good?"

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Sequitur jumps. But, recognizing her, calms down. [two panels, copypaste?]</figcaption></figure>

"We're dead. But, ehh." Shrug. "<span class="x">I</span>â€™m good."

Seems to amuse her.

<i>Might as well shoot the shit.</i>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x300.png" alt=""/><br/>
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Sequitur slumps down on a log, staring out into the abyss. As prompted, Kay&nbsp;Lin joins them, and talks:</figcaption></figure>

"You're pretty chill for someone who thinks we're gonna die."

"Eh, worryin's pointless."

Not like Kay Lin seems fussed, either.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span><span class="block">Sequitur, questioning, points at her.</span> <span class="block">Itâ€™s too dark to read her expression.</span> <br/>[silhouette, side view?]</figcaption></figure>

"It's been... fun."

"That a joke?"

"Never been in a car crash before."

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Sequiturâ€™s amused.</figcaption></figure>

Yeah, night's just full of surprises, ain't it? Could'a been vampires.

Kay Lin doesn't respond. Sequitur is reminded that they haven't seen her around much before tonight.

Must be new here!

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Cue Sequitur infodump. They gesture around Kay&nbsp;Lin without really paying attention to her.</figcaption></figure>

Vampires, supposedly, live in the castle the group was (is?) headed towards; that was the goal, to see if it's really abandoned. Kinda a big deal, these rumors; there's "vamp-hunters" around and everything.

Far as Sequitur's concerned, it's all rumors. But, then again, they would've said the same about the rabbits.

At least the vampires are human. Kind of.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Kay Lin is quiet.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Sequitur is mildly concerned. [small "?"]</figcaption></figure>

Kay Lin seems distant.

"Better human than monster... right."

Mhm.

Idly Sequitur wonders if anyone's noticed either of them gone.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x150.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>They start to get up. [speech bubble?]</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x250.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Kay Lin grabs their arm.</figcaption></figure>

<i>Skin's cold.</i>

"Say, Sequitur..."

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Sequitur is sweating. Kay Lin stares right at them.</figcaption></figure>

Dead. They're all dead meat out here. <i>Prey.</i>

"Could you... do me a favor?"
