<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Gary and Joce run forwardâ€”and stop dead in their tracks.</figcaption></figure>

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Bloody scene. Kay Lin looks very, very hurt.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/><br/><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><p><span class="x">Image: </span>She staggers; Joce catches her.</p><p>Gary tries to ask something; Joce glares.</p></figcaption></figure>

Kay Lin tries to talk. "I...it's not" (her voice is strained) "s-safe here."

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x150.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>She points shakily towards the castle. Itâ€™s closer now.</figcaption></figure>

That's all Joce needs to know.

Despite Addison's protests, on they go, towards guaranteed shelter.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/1600x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Itâ€™s still quite a walk. (Joce carries Kay&nbsp;Lin.)</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/1200x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>But they <em>do</em> get there. Joce, having had Gary hold Kay&nbsp;Lin, attempts to pick the gate lock.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Foggy out. Feeling of being watched.</figcaption></figure>

Addison breaks the silence. So, they reached the big scary castle of doom, great. Are they gonna ask the *vampires* for help?

Gary, exasparated: No offense, but why is Addison even here? Addison says it's to keep an eye on them, Gary grumbles she's not doing a good job---

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Joce interrupts.</figcaption></figure>

"B-both of you."

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Glaring.</figcaption></figure>

"*Shut up.*"

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>The gate swings open. It starts to rain.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>As they step in, Kay&nbsp;Lin stirs.</figcaption></figure>

Joce takes the lead. There's got to be a shed or overhang or *some* outdoor space they can take shelter in... and then they'll turn around and go home. That's the plan.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/> <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Kay Lin pushes against Gary, wanting to get down. As Joce turns around, Addison exclaims:</figcaption></figure>

"Weren't you dying a second ago?"

"Jesus *christ*, Addison---"

But Kay Lin, stumbling to her feet, doesn't mind. (It's becoming apparent the blood on her clothes isn't hers.) There's something she needs to tell them...

<figure style="margin-bottom:0;"><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Kay Lin smiles faintly at the three and speaks:</figcaption></figure>

"I live here."

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/> <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><p><span class="x">Image: </span>They donâ€™t know how to respond to that.</p><p>Addison turns to leave; Kay Lin calls out:</p></figcaption></figure>

"Wait, wait, no, it really *is* dangerous out there---"  
"You're a freaking *vampire*?!"

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x150.png" alt=""/><br/><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x200.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>A noise from the woods startles them all.<br/>Kay Lin yanks the gate shut.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/> <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><p><span class="x">Image: </span>Something eyes the four from the trees.</p><p>As they back away, terrified, Kay Lin talks;</p></figcaption></figure>

Yeah, she's got some explaining to do.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x200.png" alt=""/><br/><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><p><span class="x">Image: </span>Mud squelches beneath the groupâ€™s feet. Rainâ€™s not letting up any time soon.</p><p>Addison stays behind Kay Lin, pointing a stick at her back. Gary has also grabbed a plank of wood, and wields it horizontally in front of him like a baseball bat; Joce, staying at the back, holds the flashlights.</p></figcaption></figure>

Kay Lin says that she was trying to bring Sequitur back when they were attacked. Yes, she is a vampire, but she's not *rabid,* and was just out socializing when they got the letter (which she didn't know existed until they did). She tagged along because she thought she might help.

Addison has doubts. "Why didn't you tell us sooner?"

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/250x300.png" alt=""/> <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/250x300.png" alt=""/> <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/250x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><p><span class="x">Image: </span>Kay Lin, whoâ€™s been holding her hands up innocently, pauses to look at Addison.</p><p>Glances down at the sharp end of the stick.</p><p>Back up. <i>Yâ€™know.</i></p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Addisonâ€™s not happy about that but pulls back slightly.<br/>Garyâ€™s turn for questions:</figcaption></figure>

Does she know anything about those weird monsters? Oh, and how about the letter-writer?

Unfortunately the answer is no, and mostly no, respectively. She's never seen the castle head, and the monsters have been around longer than her.

In fact, she thinks the castle head stays locked away *because* of the monsters. They get in all the time....

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x400.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>As the group approaches a [??shed], something growls from within.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/200x300.png" alt=""/> <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/200x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>After a moment of hesitation, Gary steps forward.</figcaption></figure>

Hey, they're all sick of walking around in the downpour, right? He'll take care of it. The [shed]'s small, it can't be *that* big.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/> <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Joce and Addison are less sure. Then Kay&nbsp;Lin speaks up:</figcaption></figure>

He's got a point. She *really* doesn't want to bring them into the main castle, but the more they stomp around out here the more likely they'll be seen. Unless they want to be wet and miserable for a few hours, this is their best bet.

Gary takes that as a go-ahead. â€™Sides, he's already seen what he came here for.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Gary shoots back a thumbs-up and a wink.</figcaption></figure>

This'll be quick. Don't worry about it.
