<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>At the gate, Gary holds Kay Lin as Joce attempts to pick the lock. Addison stands back, still uncertain.</figcaption></figure>

The plan: find shelter. Lie low. Go home.

Something about this place keeps even Gary and Addison quiet. The less time they spend here, the better.

But not everyone is so subdued.

<span class="block">Going inside is... inadvisable.</span> <span class="block">Overhang it is.</span>

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>As the human trio stay dry, Addison keeps a stick pointed at Kay Lin, forcing her to stand in the rain as she talks.</figcaption></figure>

Firstly: Yes, Kay Lin is a vampire; but for the record, she's not *rabid.* She was, she says, trying to get Sequitur to return to the group when they were attacked. Before then, she was just at the party to socialize, and tagged along to help.

<span class="block">Addison has doubts.</span> <span class="block">"Why didn't you tell us sooner?"</span>

<figure id="three"><img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/au/4-19.png" alt=""/> <img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/au/4-20.png" alt=""/> <img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/au/4-21.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><p><span class="x">Image: </span>Kay Lin, whoâ€™s been holding her hands up in surrender, looks at Addison.</p><p>Glances down at the sharp end of the stick.</p><p>Looks back up, shrugs. <i>Yâ€™know.</i></p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/au/4-22.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Addisonâ€™s not happy about that but pulls back.<br/>Garyâ€™s turn for questions:</figcaption></figure>

So is Kay Lin just, like, a regular human but immortal? Can she shapeshift? Does she know anything about those rabbit-monsters? How about the letter-writer? Also, garlic, yay or nay? And---

<figure><img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/au/4-23.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Joce jabs him with her elbow. Kay Linâ€™s amused.</figcaption></figure>

Regular human: more or less. Shapeshifting: no. Rabbits: hell if she knows. Letter-writer: a name she's heard before, but she's never seen its bearer. There are some parts of the castle she's never managed to enter.

"Why not?" Gary asks. "What's so wrong with going in, anyway?"

But Kay Lin just shakes her head. Same thing she said before---dangerous to mortals. No elaboration.

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>A quiet uncertainty falls over the three. [no KL? focus on their faces, maybe slight downshot]</figcaption></figure>

[HMM eh shorten this a tad more again? interrupted by another growl; Gary's like "UGH i am so SICK of running from those things", takes the stick from Addison, *then* starts heading off.

should also mention the whole "they killed our friends" thing :U

also also the hr could be another pagebreak :,^)]

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Joce starts to speak; Gary has the same idea.</figcaption></figure>

Joce starts to thank Kay Lin, but Gary speaks louder: A'ight, then, time to bust up some rabbits.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Addison exclaims as he steps out into the rain.</figcaption></figure>

"I thought you said *not* to go towards the things that tried to kill us---"

"Through the fence!" Gary's dismissive. "Just a few little pokes." He's not just gonna stand around in the mud all night.

<figure id="rip"><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>And off he goes. Addison calls after him:</figcaption></figure>

"You're going to die."

But he came out here to make the most of it. His time, he means. Not his life. Well, that too, but---ah, forget it.
