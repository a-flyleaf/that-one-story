<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>At the gate, Gary holds Kay Lin as Joce attempts to pick the lock. Addison stands back, still uncertain.</figcaption></figure>

The plan: find shelter. Lie low. Go home.

Something about this place keeps even Gary and Addison quiet. The less time they spend here, the better.

But not everyone is so subdued.

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>The human trio take shelter beneath an overhang; Addison keeps a stick pointed at Kay Lin, forcing her to stand in the rain.</figcaption></figure>

Firstly: Yes, Kay Lin is a vampire; but no, she's not *rabid.* She says she was trying to get Sequitur to return to the group when they were attacked. Before then, she was just at the party to socialize, and tagged along to help.

<span class="block">Addison has doubts.</span> <span class="block">"Why didn't you tell us sooner?"</span>

<figure id="three"><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/200x300.png" alt=""/> <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/200x300.png" alt=""/> <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/200x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><p><span class="x">Image: </span>Kay Lin, whoâ€™s been holding her hands up innocently, looks at Addison.</p><p>Glances down at the sharp end of the stick.</p><p>Looks back up. <i>Yâ€™know.</i></p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Addisonâ€™s not happy about that but pulls back slightly.<br/>Garyâ€™s turn for questions:</figcaption></figure>

So is Kay Lin just, like, a regular human but immortal? Can she shapeshift? Does she know anything about those rabbit-monsters? How about the letter-writer? Also, garlic, yay or nay? And---

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Joce jabs him with her elbow.</figcaption></figure>

Regular human: more or less. Shapeshifting: no. Rabbits: hell if she knows. Letter-writer: a name she's heard before, but she's never seen its bearer. There are some parts of the castle she's never managed to enter.

"Why not?" Gary asks. "Can we go in?"

<span class="block">But Kay Lin shakes her head,</span> <span class="block">and says nothing more.</span>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Joce and Addison are uncertain; Gary, meanwhile, is disappointed. All are silent.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Joce starts to speak; Gary has the same idea.</figcaption></figure>

Joce starts to thank Kay Lin, but Gary speaks louder: A'ight, then, time to bust up some rabbits.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Addison exclaims as he steps out into the rain.</figcaption></figure>

"I thought you said *not* to go towards the things that tried to kill us---"

"Through the fence!" Gary's dismissive. "Just a few little pokes." He's not just gonna stand around in the mud all night.

<figure id="rip"><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>And off he goes. Addison calls after him:</figcaption></figure>

"You're going to die."

But he came out here to make the most of it. His time, he means. Not his life. Well, that too, but---ah, forget it.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>His voice trails off. Joce and Addison exchange a look.</figcaption></figure>
