<figcaption><p><span class="x">Image: </span>Picking up immediately where the last part left off, ‚Äúthe narrator‚Äù has been reduced to a pile of ash; only his fangs remain.</p><p>In the background, Addison has joined Joce in the doorway; both face Kay&nbsp;Lin, defensive.</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Addison has an arm out in front of Joce (who‚Äôs a bit baffled by the gesture but not protesting), and points at Kay Lin, disturbed.</figcaption></figure>

"Listen, I don't know who the *hell* you are or what you want, but s-*stay away from us*. Got it?"

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><p><span class="x">Image: </span>Kay Lin stares. She and Addison glance at Joce. Dead silence.</p><p>Then:</p></figcaption></figure>

"You don't know what he was about to do to you."

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>But Kay Lin steps back, raising her palms slightly. Addison grabs Joce and high-tails it.</figcaption></figure>

"---H-hey, are y- are you--?"  
"I'm *fine.* I am *fine,* don't ask, let's *go*."

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x600.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>The castle interior looms; tangled staircases and rotting rooms abound. Navigating it is like an impossible puzzle.</figcaption></figure>

It's hard to be sure if or when they're out of Kay&nbsp;Lin's earshot. Eventually, Joce asks if they're looking for something.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Addison is exasperated.</figcaption></figure>

"Aren't *you?* What are you even trying to accomplish here?"

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Now Joce is on defense.</figcaption></figure>

Joce tries to reiterate the plan: stay the night, leave. But Addison's frazzled; she hates this place, hates the people here, she was gonna ask how Joce even knows anyone but at this point she just doesn't care. Why <em style="text-transform:uppercase; font-style:normal;">not</em> just go out and get eaten by a... were-rabbit or whatever the hell.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>As Addison rants, Joce is miffed. Mildly concerned, but mostly miffed.</figcaption></figure>

"O-okay, then. Why not-- why n-not just, go, then. Leave. Walk out."

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Addison stops ranting to just <em>look</em> at Joce, almost dumbfounded.</figcaption></figure>

"I d-- I don't *want* you to, but---"  
"We. *Can't.*"

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>They‚Äôve reached an impasse.</figcaption></figure>

Addison, at wit's end, reiterates what the vampire boy told her: that only a vampire can leave, or open doors, or, whatever. And maybe she's the night's #1 idiot for believing him (although *someone* sure didn't want him to stick around)--- But sure enough, when they try:

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Joce kneels at a door, squinting at the keyhole. She can‚Äôt get it. Addison stands back, defeated.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Banging or kicking it down (which they both try) doesn‚Äôt work either.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Throwing or ramming things at it is also futile, but at least it‚Äôs stress relief.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>At the end of it all, they‚Äôre wiped as ever. [just headshots/torso-ups, focus on expressions]</figcaption></figure>

Rendered nearly breathless, Addison asks Joce what Kay Lin was even doing earlier. Learn anything useful...?

Joce replies, nothing shocking, idle chatter; it doesn't register. Addison is drained.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Addison sways, suddenly dizzy; Joce notices just in time to support her.[zoom out side views, 2 panels?]</figcaption></figure>

Again, Addison insists she's fine. But when Joce asks if she wants to lie down, there's no protest.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>When she does, Joce stays standing.</figcaption></figure>

Addison, bleary, says Joce can have her turn in a bit. And uh, by the way, if she *does* find this letter-writer person... then what?

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Joce is uncertain. Not looking back all the way.</figcaption></figure>

Mm. Hard to say. But she definitely, did, want to do *something,* because she didn't think... that person was...

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x200.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Addison is sleeping.</figcaption></figure>

...still alive.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x200.png" alt=""/><br/><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x200.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Joce smiles faintly, strained. Then throws her coat over Addison‚Äîscarf and all.</figcaption></figure>

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Fading to white, a figure appears in the distance.</figcaption></figure>

<div class="wrap left"><figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/250x400.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Addison, foolishly hopeful, does not care.</figcaption></figure></div>

She calls out.
