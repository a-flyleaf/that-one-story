"What is *with* you and that girl, anyway?"

"And, yeah, maybe my tone was a little harsh. It took a while for Joce to answer. And when she did, she had this whole spiel:

"They'd only just met, her and the girl, Ka... Katelyn, whatever she's called, if that's even her real name. The *vampire* hadn't hurt us, didn't even ambush Joce or anything. (Which, true, but, low bar?) While Joce was searching the vamp-girl followed and just... made small talk, apparently, told her about the place, but nothing useful.

"Then they heard something, and whatshername left to make sure 'the other one wasn't causing trouble.' And I'm like, '*Which* other one,' and Joce has no clue. That's why she followed, Joce did, and they both barged in.

"Does that make sense? I feel like I'm not making sense.

"Not like anything has, since we got there. Joce was---I guess she'd been looking for a key? I thought she'd ditched me, that's what the other guy said, the one who got stabbed to ash. I told Joce she better not leave me behind again. She gave me a funny look, stammered something like 'I didn't--- You'd said---'. That's all.

And I'm thinking, am I going crazy? Am I being double-gaslit? Does it even matter anymore?

"Where the hell *were* we? Joce asked if I'd found anything, and I don't know what she's talking about, and I'm not gonna lie, I got upset. Why am *I* getting interrogated, y'know? How did we get here?

"All I know is that I read some stupid book and it said mortals couldn't last here, and the fang boy said the same thing, and maybe they're both lying, but I didn't even want to tell her what happens to the bodies, that was too much.
