Beginning. Middle. End.

OH WHAT IF ALTERNATING VISUALS like: mostly text, mostly images, mostly text, mostly images, etc. jazz it up a bit

## start/pre-story
Whilst at a house party, Joce receives an invitation to the sender's residence. When the others find out, Gary proposes a group field trip, just for fun (and, theoretically, for safety). Joce, though hesitant, casts the deciding vote: out they go.

OFFSCREEN: While driving through the woods, the group has an unfortunate encounter with rabbits. The driver is lost; the others flee.

## VIII: ROADTRIP GONE WRONG? (txt)
Newspaper clipping, dated November 1: A truck was discovered offroad around what locals claim are traces of were-rabbits; the vehicle itself was empty. (Invitation left behind?) Locals and tourists alike are reminded to stay inside at night, and that the north woods (where the crash was reported), and *especially* the castle grounds beyond them, are strictly off-limits.

## VII (img)
Having fled the scene of the crash, the group is lost, but the castle's in sight; Gary thinks they should move towards it, Addison argues otherwise, but splitting is suicide either way. Sequitur wanders off and is approached by Kay Lin, who's new to the group; they warn her about the supposed vampires. Kay Lin has a favor to ask; it occurs to Sequitur they're far away from the others.

## VI (txt)
The final writings of a vampire hunter: While searching the woods (going directly to the castle would of course be fatal), the hunter witnessed a vampire asking a human for permission to feed, and the human "consenting." This, unsurprisingly, killed the human; expository tangent about vampiric bloodlust. The hunter speaks vaguely of encountering the vampire firsthand, and leaves the end vague.

## V (img)
The group finds Kay Lin battered and bloodied, having been attacked (implicitly the assailant took Sequitur); to the castle it is, then. Upon arrival Kay Lin seems to be doing better, prompting suspicion, but lurking rabbits force the group to find shelter anyway. When they find a ?shed, Gary (who's been feeling like a useless bystander) steps forward to clear it out, reassuring the others that it'll be fine.

## IV (txt)
When Caleb saw Addison pushing Kay Lin around he was immediately smitten; her state after Gary's demise only endears him more. He disregards Kay Lin's warnings to keep away, and tries to convince Addison to let him turn her; the castle is inevitably fatal to all mortals who enter. Kay Lin intervenes and kills Caleb.

## III (img)
Addison tells Kay Lin to stay the hell away from her and Joce, and tries to get Joce to say more about the invitation and how she knows the writer. Joce resists, put off by the questioning, but they stick together to search for a way through. (+Addison finds something important??) As the night drags on Addison grows increasingly tired; when she falls asleep she dreams of "WR" welcoming her.

## II (txt)
Flashback: Kay Lin met Joce at the party, away from the others (who found the invite in a bottle). Despite initial ambivalence, Kay Lin has grown attached to Joce, and now doesn't want to kill her despite increasing hunger. (< ideally Show this rather than tell but idk how.) Cutting back to the present, Addison has died, and Kay Lin confirms that Caleb was right: the castle will *inherently* kill mortal inhabitants, and only vampires can leave.

## I (img)
Kay Lin offers to turn Joce, borderline insists on it. Joce confesses that she was bitten by the writer years ago but survived, so she might be resistant; realizing this (that Joce will either die slowly or KL *will* lose control and attack her), Kay Lin gives up the key (n.b. does not have to be literal) and recedes. Still unsure whether to seek vengeance or leave, Joce steps through the door.
