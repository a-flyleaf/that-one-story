You know, I've tried to be good, I really, truly have. If I spent *one* more second in this empty abyss of a castle I would've lost my fucking marbles. It's not *my* fault the other two would rather wither away for centuries than go *out* sometimes! Hell, I didn't even know one of them *existed* until tonight.

'Oh, Kay&nbsp;Lin, you mustn't subject the mortals to your corrosive presence, for it's only a matter of time before you' blablabla I *get* it. I do! I don't have the world's best self-control either, I know, but at least I *try*. And I think I'm getting better, even if we're just counting tonight. I've had so many opportunities to just... be *worse,* and I didn't, and we've made it all the way here and it's not even my fault most of them died.

I mean. I *guess* I could've said something, about this place being radioactive, or whatever. Maybe I was being a little selfish pointing you this way, because I was *hurting* and not exactly thinking clearly.

But, what, would you prefer I just... never showed up at all?

Then you'd all be rabbit bait. You wouldn't even know to come here. Or if you *had* made it, then I'd *really* be starving, and we wouldn't even get to say hello.

I did you a favor. So I think the *least* you can do is pay it back?

Look, I'm not some creep like Caleb. If I agreed with him I wouldn't have, y'know, *killed him*, to get him out of your faces for a while. I know you're sad and desperate or whatever, and I don't want to take advantage of you.

I actually *like* you. It makes *me* sad to watch you dig around like there's some hidden key to get out of here; there's not, I'm telling you, and I never *wanted* it to come to this. I don't know how you've survived this long, but if you make it to morning, it's not gonna mean anything; the doors don't magically unlock when the sun rises.

You *need* my help. I'm telling you to *take it*, while I can still *control it*. It's not that hard.

I don't even think you'd *mind* being a vampire, is the funny thing. So what if we never find out if the castle head is real or not? You already don't fit in with humans.

No offense. But come *on*, how long had you been out on the back porch alone when I found you? The whole time? I mean, the party was driving me batty too (haha, *batty,* now you get it---I don't shapeshift, though, promise), but my excuse was that if I kept having to be around people I might've gone feral or whatever. You just got locked out.

...Okay, that was low, sorry. I don't think anyone did that to you on *purpose*, if it makes you feel any better. But---look, my point is, outcast buddies? Y'know, you, me, eternity in this--- Alright, I *know* I've been making it sound pretty miserable, but I swear it's---

...

...Huh?

Oh, you *know* I'm not gonna shut up now, right? (I mean, I'd guess you don't mind it *too* much, since you haven't attacked me yet or anything. Or maybe you're just waiting to backstab me, ha.) But hey, no, listen, you can't backpedal on this--- "Heard it before," that's not about me, is it.

[asdksdgkhssdfjs ok I don't think she'd be saying ALL this out loud is the thing. KL's not That talkative. maybe more like... filling in the "missing" scenes a bit, BRIEFLY? meeting, during the addison/gary arguing, way later just now (while caleb talks to addison), and NOW here we are.

that said this part has been bugging me for days and I'm just gonna leave this here & plow through the last part. writing is hard]

THROUGHLINE: "I want this but I shouldn't," whether "it" is going out and Making Friends or attacking said 'friends' and now what to do about Joce being stuck and doomed here. yay

wonder if we can squish it all into like, 3-ish "parts" maximum... probably few to no pictures for a change\*, not necessarily all monologued but safe to assume *some* is said aloud, ends with revelation that Joce has been bitten and KL's like "oh. oh, *shit*" and goes off to nuke herself/leave Joce the "key."

\*this part's important because the finale is *no* text, other than image captions. hmm, we kinda lose Joce's motivations this way; maybe some of the blank-filling can have her like, talking about that herself? idk, it's sorta ooc but everyone's character is being stretched here....
