- general pages to update: index (ToC thumbnails), notyet (date, preview), splash chapter count
- relink next part on latest update
- move new parts out of notyet folder
- last part links to notyet, "?" sym

basically just speedrun-click through everything and make sure there's no broken links; saving all those commits for later so it doesn't accidentally get pushed with a wip update
