"I don't think I've been *all there* since we stepped in here, is the thing.

"I'll have these brief moments where I can get the story straight, like when the long-toothed vampire was talking to me, but then I feel like some kind of caged animal.

"Anyway. You didn't have to be so startled to see me. I just thought maybe you should quiet down, maybe take a nap. I asked, who even *was* this letter-writer castle-head person-vampire, which must've been one of the crazy moments because you obviously have no relation.

"No, wait---*you* found it, but it was *for* Joce, and--- Well, I guess it doesn't matter, since everyone jumped on the bandwagon to follow it back to the mystery sender. Joce said *she* knew who it was, and they hadn't spoken in years, but not much else. That's what happened. I'm *certain* that's what happened. I *saw* it, and I didn't *want* to go, but---

"Look. This sounds stupid, but... you're half the reason I agreed to this. I mean, I wanted to get out, too, but I didn't want to *trespass*---and that was *before* we found out why the woods are off-limits.

"That... really upset me, you know? Maybe I'm just being overly sentimental because, oh, I don't know, we saw you *get dragged out of the freaking truck and eaten alive.*

"Anyway. I... appreciate the concern, but I'm fine, now, really. J... Ka---no, that's not it, what did it start with...

"The person I was with, at one point, said the letter-writer is dead, or supposed to be, which I guess confirms yet another goddamn vampire, but when I heard that, I thought it meant *you* had a chance, you and everyone else.
