A twitchy survivalist-wannabe warily teams up with a suspiciously-careless girl in a thrilling, destructive hellscape.

Website for a story-project-thing that spawned around early 2021. Envisioned as a ~~12~~ 11-part comic series; for <a href="https://a-flyleaf.github.io/blog/project-rambling#now-what" class="ext">various reasons</a> I won't be executing it so conventionally. Whatever comes of it, it'll be on this site.

> Content note: **Story contains mature themes.** There is no explicit gore or nudity. Art may feature body horror. Creator has chosen not to use more specific warnings.

In the mean time, this site houses [story-related art]({%include url.html%}/gallery). Major updates are noted on the [changelog]({%include url.html%}/changelog).

## on spoilers
Because of the haphazard way I've been making stuff for this thing, **spoilers are everywhere**, frequently with little to no indication that they are in fact spoilers. Subsequently I'm not too fussed about withholding things.

That said, if I think something is especially significant, it'll be hidden; text is grayed out <span class="spoiler">like this</span>, and images are obscured like this:

{%include figure.html
	img="carless"
	caption="If the image appears normal to you by default, your browser doesnâ€™t support <a href='https://caniuse.com/css-filters' class='ext'>CSS filters</a>."
	spoiler=""
%}
