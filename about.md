## the story
> A twitchy survivalist-wannabe warily teams up with a suspiciously-careless girl in a thrilling, destructive hellscape.

Envisioned as a 12-part series. Theoretically it would be a full comic start to finish; in practice, I'm messing with it and seeing where it goes. (<a href="https://a-flyleaf.github.io/blog/project-rambling#now-what" target="_blank">More rambling on that here</a>). Stuff you can expect:

- copious amounts of "concept art" and other scribbles, with varying amounts of context
- comics for actual scenes
- written description to some extent, maybe?

~We'll see~

> Content note: Story **contains mature themes**. There is no explicit gore or nudity. Art may feature body horror. Author has chosen not to use more specific warnings.

## the site
Because a majority of art has been posted <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/gallery?q=%23unmooredrandos" target="_blank">offsite</a> with little regard for spoilers, I decided to make a few pages to compile everything for a smoother browsing experience.

For the most part, there is no indication of "spoilers"; browse artdumps at your own risk. But if I think something warrants hiding, it'll be grayed out <span class="spoiler">like this</span>; click to show/hide. Images may also be "hidden," like so:

<figure><div class="spoilerbox"><img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/about-temp.png" alt="" class="spoiler"></div><figcaption>If the image appears normal to you by default, your browser doesn’t support <a href='https://caniuse.com/css-filters' target='_blank'>CSS filters</a>.</figcaption></figure>
