<i>You're gonna be the death of me</i> is a psychological drama in 11 parts. Envisioned primarily as a comic, though in practice the presentation is being winged. This website is an attempt to pull it all together.

## on spoilers
There is currently no way to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_(media)" class="ext">spoiler</a>-free. Cast pages are somewhat curated; gallery pages are not whatsoever. Also note that not every character is introduced within the first part, let alone by name; **all cast and gallery pages**, however, assume everyone is known.

Proceed with however much caution seems appropriate.
