Website for a story-project-thing that spawned around early 2021. Envisioned as a ~~12~~ 11-part comic series; for <a href="https://a-flyleaf.github.io/blog/project-rambling#now-what" class="ext">various reasons</a> I won't be executing it so conventionally. Whatever comes of it, it'll be on this site.

> Content note: **Story contains mature themes.** There is no explicit gore or nudity. Art may feature body horror. Creator has chosen not to use more specific warnings.

In the mean time, this site houses [story-related art]({%include url.html%}/gallery). Major updates are noted on the [changelog]({%include url.html%}/changelog).

## on spoilers
Because of the haphazard way I've been making stuff for this thing, **spoilers are everywhere**, frequently with little to no indication that they are in fact spoilers. Subsequently I'm not too fussed about withholding things.

That said, if I think something is especially significant, it'll be hidden; text is grayed out <span class="spoiler">like this</span>, and images are obscured like this:

{%include figure.html
	img="carless"
	alt="Should appear indecipherably blurry. Full caption below."
	caption="<p>If the image appears normal to you by default, your browser doesn’t support <a href='https://caniuse.com/css-filters' class='ext'>CSS filters</a>.</p>
		<details class='imgdesc'><summary>image description</summary>
		<p>Snippet from <a href='ygbtdm/gallery/roundups/2021-12'>a monthly art roundup</a>. On the top is a screenshot of an older version of this page, then titled “synopsis.” Continuing the screenshot is the header “in a sentence,” followed by “A twitchy survivalist-wannabe warily teams up with a suspiciously-carless girl in a thrilling, destructive hellscape.” To the side of the screenshot is a handwritten note: “sent this to a friend. made a typo.” and, in a smaller/faded note in all-caps, “<span style='text-transform:uppercase;'>I love writing</span>.”</p>
		<p>A crudely-rendered doodle below enlarges the typo, “suspiciously-carless.” One main character yells from a grocery store kiddie car, “<span style='text-transform:uppercase;'>Get in kiddo, we’re going karting.</span>” The smaller character says, more quietly, “I… have a license…”; declares the first: “<span style='text-transform:uppercase;'>Bullshit</span>”</p></details>"

## misc. notes
With code nerd thanks to the following resources, for the spoiler JavaScript: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/19075983" class="ext">StackOverflow</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_queryselector.asp" class="ext">w3schools</a>, and <a href="https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/javascript-addeventlistener-queryselectorall" class="ext">Borislav Hadzhiev</a>.

Images here and on [the cast pages]({%include url.html%}/cast) should have captions or descriptions; working on the rest.
