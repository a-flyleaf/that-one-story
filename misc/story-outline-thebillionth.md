bullet 👏 point 👏 hell 👏👏👏

essentially copypasted from the outline/checklist, but now with full sentences. plus minor *minor* changes as noted in more recent outlines
<!--as with the original checklist, scenes don't really have titles for the most part; these just make it clearer where one segment ends and another begins, even if the transition is seamless-->

## 01: Relapse
- Joce wakes up in the underground. [Cue OP?]<!--intro/wakeup-->
- As a kid, Joce tried to be a hero. Only one person listened---but eventually, they left.<!--static-->
- Life's been formless. Joce's housemates try to help.<!--hollow-->
- Back in the underground, some introductions go better than others.<!--first impressions-->
- The first challenge is more harrowing than anticipated.<!--challenge1-->
- It takes a nudge, but out Joce and Kay Lin head out.<!--out-->
- After making little conversational progress, Joce investigates a noise. The aftermath forces confrontations on multiple accounts.<!--wrong choice-->
- Back at the Beacon, someone joins the alliance.<!--deal1-->
- Joce has doubts; Kay Lin gives them a voice. But the day ends in silence.<!--together-->

## Follow me
- Addison proposes a deal. [cue OP]<!--intro/deal2-->
- Joce and Kay Lin test the world's limits. [Meanwhile Addison?]<!--[idk title]-->
- Joce and the alliance's paths cross once more. Results are fatal.<!--start over-->
- In the aftermath, Joce and Kay Lin try to listen. The alliance, not so much.<!--listen-->
- Addison ventures underground; someone's there for her.<!--[idk title; includes both monologue and collapse?]-->

## 02: Follow me
- listen: J+KL followup → alliance mockery, speech failure → A underground → monologue, "someone worth saving;" C
- left-behind: A+C talk → pendant → cave-in
- challenge2: loud

## 03: Not her
- challenge2: groups → entire game?
- scapegoat: interim → round2 → C accusations, G steps in
- watching: J/KL sendoff → J investigation, trip+fall
- dinner: C fauxpology → awkward, "Yeah, Kayla" etc. → spill
- slurry: <-- all that noise
- cornered: J+KL outside → J self-justification → C chasedown → C kill → KL has no personal space

## 04: Lie in it
- error: game/catchup → victory
- unsolicited: prizes, J "leaves" → G invitation → J crashes
- stutter: wakeup, bottle → failure to interact → G+KL, panic → J warning/admission
- found: J+D map talk, enter G → "Don't hurt her--"
- target: J>KL not-escape → near-fight → G sendoff

## 05: Desperately safe
- neurosis: J+KL argue/rabbit attack → recognition
- kindred: success → reconciliation, "Here's to being fucked up." → alas poor rabbit, shelter get
- too-close: J dissatisfied, sneaks out → quiet underground → G talk → letter → rabbits → cave-in → hand hold

## 06: So it goes
- intro/trying: despondent exercise
- haze: flashback x3 combo (meeting, smoke, proposal), scarce KL → KL snaps/returns/?out flashbacks (cheating, initial & montage)
- locked: flashback (lockout); KL cornered → J finds G → KL K-O'd → J triggers cave-in
	- imagining a tight back-and-forth here, not sure how the page division will go

## 07: Despite everything
- intro/alone: KL wakeup
- oddly-threatening: J+Sq → KL still alone
- liar: D reveal & banter, J crashes in →  KL confessional → "...Yeah. You do."
- and-yet: J (fake)out, D disappointed → double K-O → escape, monologue/hero sequence (flashback end)
- exposed: alliance, vulnerable moment

## 08: No one else
- intro/no: KL+E Beacon flashback → KL wakes up
	- "no" is redundant but idk what else to call this; "nonononono" is silly out of context & annoying to remember
- promise: J+KL catchup → J returns pendant, "Don't make promises you can't keep." → J leaves, voiceover into J+WR
- stronger: alliance outing → challenge split, panic → WR complies, celebration
- jubilant: campfire talk, KL off → KL pendant/rabbit story → J+KL sendoff/J suggestion
- silence: KL not there → "...Em?"

## 09: But you
- (no title sequence?)
- ghost: KL+WR → J confronts, g'night → KL+Sq → "They're gone."
- suffocating: KL>Sq threat → J+WR trackdown, E's perspective
- leave-her: KL>Seq frustration, WR break-in → WR+Sq/J+KL, rabbits → u-turn/cave-in (→ cliffhanger?)

## 10: You can't save her
- intro/again: Sq+WR → J wakes up, trail
- following: J loses trail, finds alliance → filled in, rabbits → left, pulled back in → D says hello
- idly: WR out? → D+J motive interrogation--"From what? Herself?"
	- not sure on title; thoughtless, autopilot, something to the effect of "just acting on instinct, not seriously considering the ramifications." not quite *careless* ~~carless lol~~ though, it's more subconscious
- persist: D+J voiceover/fade, J spiraling up; "Terrance is my deadbeat brother" → A → A pathetic, "You can't give up now" → mistake.jpg → enter WR
- savior: "I'm here to save you," J refuses → chasedown tango "This place... these *people* change you." → WR nearly kiled, J leaves; rabbit-smash, "Do you think you're a fucking hero?"
- apex: KL's been waiting → goal reveal (confirmation?), heroism taunting → J doesn't, KL threatens → J assesses → hug
	- kinda eh on the title but "peak" doesn't Sound right, "climax" is too on-the-nose
- fall: pendant toss, sorry → J leaves

## 11: I miss you
- (no intro?)
- awake: J rises, observes room → down the hall → door ajar
	- "rises, observes room" is such dry-ass phrasing but I know what I'm referring to and That's What Matters(TM)
- release: there she is → as J works, KL wants out → bright, wake up → alone; "Thank you...! And... good bye."
- choice: Sq+WR, "Was this worth it?", "You think I'll make it?" → "DON'T GO"
- neighbor: <-- that scene
- anew: sendoff montage/letter, fade to black
