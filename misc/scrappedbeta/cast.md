I'm hoping the characterizations speak for themselves, so the main cast's notes are:
- height, age, color association
- speech and/or expression pattern(s)
- core motivation(s)
	- and why
- anything else that scene descriptions don't cover but seemed relevant

And for recurring/minor characters, it's whatever makes them worth noting.

## Joce
- 6\'1\". 24, nearly 25. Dull yellow (looks green), later warm brown.
- Twitchy. Speaks quickly, often stutters. Mildly to severely disheveled.
- Just wants to live. If she can be a decent person while she's at it, even better.
	- Has always had constant background thoughts of impending disaster and/or her own immorality. Idolizes the "jerk with a heart of gold" archetype and figures the best she can do is emulate it.
- The erratic behavior was worse when she was young. It flares up more when stressed in general.

## Kay Lin
- 4\'3\". Early 20s, but looks much younger. Purple, saturation varies.
- More lively than initial impressions suggest. A bit of a tease. If blank-faced, something is off.
- <span class="spoiler">Wants to self-destruct, basically. Barring that, craves company.</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">Bases self-worth on ability to satisfy others. Otherwise, she clings to whoever can fill (and/or distract her from) that existential void.</span>
- Ocasionally shown with yellow/gold irises, except for <span class="spoiler">Em flashbacks and the final part</span>. This is never commented on.

## Addison
- 5\'5\". 20-ish. Orange, usually bright & saturated.
- Smiles through gritted teeth. Poise is performative. More expressive when agitated.
- Wants to make a name for herself. For grandiose reasons, obviously.
	- Daughter of a local politician; can be a little overenthusiastic about the "wrong" things, and aggressively overcompensates. Not used to being told "no" or otherwise put down.
- Thought this was going to be a great networking opportunity.

## Caleb
- 4\'0\". Apparently 18 or older. Pink, the more pastel the better.
- Voice cracks a lot out of sheer panic. Eyebrows rarely unfurrowed, mouth line usually wobbly. Concerningly attached.
- Wants to get stronger. <span class="spoiler">Which translates to "overpower someone, in some way."</span>
	- Has been bullied his entire life and can never keep friends long. <span class="spoiler">Would love to take his shit out on someone who (he thinks) deserves it.</span>
- Can barely lift his bat, but he tries sometimes.

## Gary
- 5\'7.5\". 19. Deep reddish-brown.
- Gregarious, loud, has some kinda heavy American accent. Big gestures. Touchy, but tries to notice when people don't like it.
- Wants to have a good time—and make sure his pals are having one, too.
	- Small town hockey star with a big heart. That's his *gig,* man. Anything else is ~~scary~~ pointless drama, isn't it?
- Has complete heterochromia (one eye green, other blue). Would have freckles if ~~I could be assed to draw them~~ the style was more detailed.

## "The accountant"
- \>6\'6\". 30s. Aqua, blue-green, whatever you call the midtone.
- Prominent accent of indiscernible origin. Speaks quickly but distinctly. Gestures almost entirely with hands, with peculiar finger placement.
- Generally enjoys toying with people. But in the context of the game, <span class="spoiler">wants to dissect why anyone would be so knowingly self-destructive.</span>
	- Has a finely-tuned memory; learned to compensate for social oddness with sharp people-reading. <span class="spoiler">Her older brother, Terry, was given everything on a silver platter and squandered it all; no paper on the chemistry of addiction has been enough to explain why she still supports him.</span>
- Like Kay Lin, rendered with white pupils. This is also not commented on.

## Sequitur
- 6\'1\", but slouches a ton. 20s. Indigo, hypersaturated or faded near-gray.
- Suuuuuuuuper slow, tends to drag out sounds. Often seen picking their teeth and/or doing "raptor hands." Awkward motions.
- Doesn't really want much of anything. Isn't sure how they got here, but i's whatever, y'feel?
	- Believes the best way to a chill life is to have no expectations. Jury's still out on whether this is enlightened or defeatist.
- Fun fact, the band logo on their shirt is what inspired the whole rabbit motif (in a meta-development sense; no in-story relation).

## "White Rabbit"
- 5\'11\". 20s. Pale blue-gray-yellow.
- Silent. Often seen slinging a bat over one shoulder. Most expressive via charades.
- <span class="spoiler">Wants to stay here forever. Dreads the consequences of leaving.</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">Associates disappointing people with pain, and has decided to <em>assertively</em> being a letdown. When she <em>does</em> accidentally give people expectations, she regrets it.</span>
- <span class="spoiler">Was quiet before the game, too, but gestured a tad more. Rarely made direct eye contact. Under the mask, she seems to stare right through people.</span>

## other recurring

### "the fallen"
The game's first casualty. Wears a necklace. <span class="spoiler">Joce recognizes them in the first rabbit that attacks her and Kay Lin.</span>

### Joce's housemates
Two people who tend to annoy Joce with their usual couple antics. One is more thoughtful than the other. <span class="spoiler">At the end, Joce befriends the latter.</span>

### "Wolf"
One of two masked "deputies" Addison keeps close; nicknamed for the plastic knockoff wolf mask they\* wear 24/7. Hot-headed, assertive, and outgoing. <span class="spoiler">After Addison's death, they take over the alliance, but meet their demise to rabbits at some point offscreen.</span> Probably jealous of White Rabbit.

<span style="font-size:.75em;">\*idk gender lol</span>

### "nameless"
A competitor who looks vaguely similar to Kay Lin. Quiet and unassuming.

### Salvador Skoal Flores
aka <i>Sal</i>, the writer of the letter Joce receives alongside the game invitation. <span class="spoiler">Joce's ex (implicit fiancé), who apparently hasn't gotten over her.</span>

### [medic]
An alliance loyalist. Joce is on good terms with them\* later.

<span style="font-size:.75em;">\*neutral "they"? undecided-gender "they"? we shall see</span>

Bonus factoid: Despite names being a bit of a Theme here, it's more thematically-relevant that a name is *known* (or not) than what the name actually *is*. (By which I mean, if any of these monikers are ~meaningful~ it is a total coincidence. *Finding names that Sound Right is a struggle as-is okay,,*)
