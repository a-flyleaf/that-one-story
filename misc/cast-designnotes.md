Companion to the [general cast summaries](castnotes), also from today (2022/9/7).

## general
I don't care about **precise color hex codes** <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">or</em> **height measurements**; they're provided here anyway for convenience. **Relative** colors (value + hue) and heights (where one character stands proportional to another) are more important.

Similarly, while some design details are key (for characterization and/or thematic reasons), others are a byproduct of art style; for instance, I use black and white fairly deliberately here, but hair is often exaggerated for silhouette. Then there's stuff like Kay Lin's eye color where the distinction between diegesis and stylization is besides the point. I've tried to note which is which.

- ! = important
- ~ = personal style thing
- else assume it's not *vital* but not trivial either

## template
> leave palette/height blank for now, ignore height for Sal + flashback Joces
- core palette: [skin, hair, eyes]
- height: X\'XX\"
- general design shape/motif(s), incl. build

Paragraph-style (but not necessarily full sentence, fragments are fine) descriptions of particular details. Prioritize by "ephemerality"; face (jawbone, eye/brow/nose shapes, related) precedes skin precedes clothes etc. Don't forget to note the aforementioned "this is stylistic/this is important" details! (Use symbols?)

## Joce
- core palette: [skin\*, hair, eyes]
- height: X\'XX\" (default, not in flashbacks)
- Stocky and angular (square+triangle); more fat than muscle. Should **not** look thin; sole exception is blue phase [which tbh I should redraw a bit, shouldn't look like the whole *skeletal proportions* change...]

## quicknotes
- Joce: noticeable nose bridge, underbite, frayed eyebrows, just scrutinize every little detail (on everyone else, too) you know the drill
- KL: obligate eye color thing. hair is 100% straight, it just looks messy as hell in that endgame phase. bandage-wraps are wildly inconsistent idc, but the cleaner ones are usually just 3 (style/simplification thing)
	- idgaf about the button-down opacity but it should be the same off-white as WR's ~thing
- Addison: has a hair clip-thing in the back! for like one part and then she takes it off (even though it matches the belt/shoelace color?) and it doesn't make much of a difference anyway because her hair's short, go figure
- Caleb: leggings can have details I just can't be assed to draw any. mouth is almost never a straight line or even simple curve, gotta have some wobble (or at *least* a ":3" mouth, he's the only one who could actually do it)
- Gary: mans got lego/layton eyes. would have freckles, ~~shoe whites are~~ palette from the waist down is kind of an oddball but I ain't changing it at this point, ~yeah~
- Diana: those are contacts, the pointy white pupil is a stylization thing but she *would* have matching irises. for shits.
- Sequitur: sleeve stripe count doesn't matter, those + logo + hair fade would've been indigo when new. neck is always kinda hunched/long (exaggerated for style but they *do* have an awful slouch). it's a miracle the slippers haven't come off yet.
- Em: side-eyes disappear in full color big F, but that *is* important (the thing with the "pupils" always touching the eye line UNLESS noticeably shocked). WR eyes usually drawn as an incomplete curve suggesting shadow, but it Does Not Matter where they are in 3d space. it's a void in there. (not literally but it should have zero discernible detail, even in bright light; this is diegetic for handwavey reasons.)
