"other/misc" cast page: sal & hellrabbits might warrant new pages; otherwise neighbors, wolf-skull, nameless, medic

# main cast

stick to physical descriptions, demeanor shifts? doing an all-out bio would get unwieldly with some people (namely J+KL)  
alternatively do it like a TL;DR wiki? or maybe like, instead of the usual bio, just summarize what they Do in each episode. that should do it, and covers as much of their backstory as is relevant (without getting too diegetic about everything)

this is definitely not suppoed to be public but what the hell.

## Joce
- alternate designs: kid, teen, w/Sal, endgame
- is in ALL the episodes. literally all of them
### trivia
- insp: that one old drawing (but with curly hair), TLOU (specifically Joel & Marlene), that whole "jerkass with a heart of gold" archetype (more as her personal #LifeGoals than anything else), general personal recurring archetype of the shithead rebel kid
- songs: see album page, +"Silence"
- voice: n/a?? I like this one streamer's laugh but finding a voiceclaim for her is hard, she has a v. particular way of talking
- was originally a lot more... tired, apparently? based on the sweater (later reused for her kid design) and general vibe. also had a switchblade but that got dropped along the way, still in-character but wasn't necessary

## Kay Lin
- alternate designs: (kid/younger?? optional, never appears in canon but Exists,) w/Em, endgame
- is in all the episodes also
### trivia
- insp: that one "honey" drawing (which kinda inadvertently set the Look of the place too), general archetype of the quiet long-haired girl, that ONE tcgf tweet about the street orphan, also toys with a lot of Val's ideas but Different
- songs: see album page, +"Honeythief"
- voice: Reoni ig
- motive hasn't changed (get protag to kill her at the end) but execution ~~har har~~ has changed a LOT (still hammy and fucked-up but no chasedown)

## Addison
- alternate designs: ep2 (jacket boots pendant), rabbit?? haven't really figured that one out
- ep1: grandstander, establishes alliance
- ep2: basically the new protag. also dies
- ep10: unfortunately dead =/= gone
### trivia
- insp: gaslight gatekeep girlboss. sorry
	- oh and that "YA Protagonist Tweets" twitter. very serious character right here
	- I joke about her being a genderbent Flynn but they're mostly surface parallels
- song: "Dialtone" Deltarune
- voice: Generic White Girl idek
- hasn't changed a whoooole lot from early drafts? got a lot more Pathos tho lucky her

## Caleb
- alternate designs: ep3 (with pendant)
- ep1+2: footnote to Addison mostly
- ep3: tries to do a vengeance and then gets killed
### trivia
- insp: tuwut (i have been trying to play with this archetype for AGES; see Ava and Levi for earlier attempts that went elsewhere)
- song: "Cry Baby" Melanie Martinez
- voice: Jacuzzi Splot Baccano
- also very similar to early drafts but more of a shithead sometimes

## Gary
- alternate designs: jacket open, semi-rabbit
- ep1: offscreen "Terry" cameo
- ep3: invites everyone to Da Caysa
- ep4: "Joce wth u good"
- ep5: :(
- ep6: 8(
### trivia
- insp: generic high school jock ig, but he turned into a softie somewhere along the line and idk how that happened
- song: "Big Fun" Heathers, at eastfor early incarnations. nowadays idek
- voice: n/a
- basically did a developmental U-turn, from The Douchebag to the token genuinely-nice guy. how'd that happen.
	- (it's because things got a lot less hammy and a hell of a lot more symbolic nyehehe)

## Diana
- alternate design: endgame
- ep1: offscreen "Terry" cameo
- ep3: amogus impostor champ, also with Gary
- ep4: "hello Joce let's do a friendship :^)"
- ep6+7: "hello Kay Lin let's do an interrogation :^)"
- ep10: hello again for a last hurrah
### trivia
- insp: Generic Anime Villain:TM: (that Val didn't quite stay as), and Terry Soul ig?. also inadvertently recycled the Parfum Master's design (and "snooty rich person" vibe ig)
- song: "Terry Time Too" Soul
- voice: also Terry, but pitched up a smidge
- characterization has kinda swung around a lot, sometimes more serious sometimes more silly; the *core* arguably hasn't changed so ig it's mostly a matter of where she's landed

## Sequitur
- no alternate designs
- ep1: appears to be a rando, theoretically
- possible sporadic cameos in the background of challenges
- ep6: gets #wasted with KL
- ep7: well darn there goes the hideout, also gives Joce a pat
- ep8: yall good
- ep9: YALL GOOD????!?
- ep10: does a lot more hand-wringing than usual
- ep11: not mad just disappointed.
### trivia
- insp: The Stoner:TM:. has parallels to Nico in that regard but not intended.
- song: n/a?? "Once in a Lifetime" sometimes idek
- voice: ???, there is a Sound in my head but idk who
- basically hasn't changed but is around long this time yay

## Em
- alternate designs: human, full rabbit
- ep1: surprise rabbit @ alliance
- ep2: kinda just There
- ep7: is leader now yey
- ep8: buddy chum pal friends with J
- ep9: less buddy chum pal friends with KL
- ep10: wtf get back here
- ep11: "DON'T GO"
### trivia
- insp: . . . :thinking emoji:??? frankly i Do Not know. plays with some shapes I sorta-used for human!Moony ig but it's very loose
- songs: "2 Heads" Coleman Hell, "Stay In Your Coma" OFF
- voice: Shep Stevenuniverse
- kinda two (not-really-developed) characters smushed into one (now with much more development); originally #8 was essentially death fodder (along with 7/later Sequtur), then I was like "what if gf" and Oops.


# other/misc

## Salvador "Skoal" Flores
- sleazy, sultry, swhathaveyou
- conglomerate of Piers Pokemon and Pepe Le Pew and the artist not knowing nearly enough about modern-gothic fashion to do the outfits justice
- song: "I'm an independent man"

## the "hellrabbits"
- much like "White Rabbit," no canonical name/title; this is just what I use in notes
- zombies, But Rabbits. very literal, physical forces in the context of the story, but don't think too much about their biological functioning
- spoiler alert They Lonely

## other
- wolf-skull: Addison's "deputy", who I ended up liking enough to throw onto ArtFight. not supposed to be important tho
	- ep2 questions Addison's leadership, ep3 goes ham in amogus. dies unceremoniously offscreen between then and ep7
- the neighbors/housemates: a couple that annoys the shit out of Joce. "cameo" appearances in ep1 and 11
	- tfw no design still
- nameless: person who vaguely resembles KL for no apparent reason. ep3 gets sussed out, ep4 accidentally jumpscares an overtired Joce, might make other sporadic bg cameos
- medic: the one (1) person Joce befriends; ep4 cameo courtesy Joce Trying To Talk To People, appears later as part of the alliance in ep7-8, tries in vain to make Joce leave in ep9
	- tfw no design also
