Descriptions & design notes, based on new references. Might convert to data (can have on its own page *and* smaller popups for the colorscripts), and/or try to integrate with images using fixed text sizes?

Kinda prosey, ignoring what's already on the cast pages.  
post-writing thought: okay, these work for summaries; can be one (1) data file with this written info and the image url. cast page can have more details, essentially an image description + design notes; ideally both in one, redundancy is fine.

**TBA**: rabbit (generic); endgame Addison (human + rabbit), Gary, and Diana; Caleb with pendant?; rabbit!Em?; kid!KL?

## Joce

### default
Tall, wide, and angular. Wears a military shirt and stern expression, with a standoffish demeanor; can appear imposing. Easily rattled, however, and noticeably so; prone to stuttering and bouts of agitated, repetitive motions (which often involve the hands). Can walk with a slight limp.

Associated with **dull yellow**.

### ep08+
Softer, less certain. Now dons rounder, more comfortable garb, which is tinted orange-brown. Color association has shifted warmer.

### kid/young teen
Scrappy kid; nothing if not boisterous. Cheap, looser clothing shows signs of wear and tear. Assorted cuts and bruises litter the skin, too. <span class="spoiler">After meeting "S.," is bestowed with a dog tag chain necklace.</span>

Associated with **desaturated reddish-brown**.

### older teen
Considerably lankier than any phase before or after. Frayed clothes and uncertain stance. Short sleeves betray assorted, sporadic scars down the arms, which armbands don't do much to help; hands are especially messy, with tight rings and bandages wrapped around most fingers.

Still has the chain, which can be pocketed or worn. Associated with **blue-gray**.

### young adult/with "S."
Quiet. Now slightly taller than S. (and shown at full height for the reference), but rarely stands tall enough for anyone to notice. May be wearing a puffy jacket (which is, of course, being picked apart at the seams) and stiff boots; outfits in general are black and white.

Associated with **gray-green**, subsumed by S.'s hues.

## Kay Lin

### default
Small, thin, and wide-eyed. Clothes are ragged, with a t-shirt that's a couple sizes too big, and neck, hands, and feet are wrapped in uneven bandages. Irises can appear bright yellow-gold. Demeanor shifts by the scene.

Associated with **purple**, dull by default.

### pre-story/with Em
Characterized by a smile, shorter hair and (given context) a faint blush; generally bouncy and excitable. Clothing is frayed, on purpose/by design; also wears bright, playful rubber bands around the wrists. Irises are dark brown, and do not appear otherwise.

Associated with a **brighter purple**.

## ep8+
Could be doing better. Cleaner bandages cover wounds new and old. Later, as shown in reference, dons an oversized off-white button-down, and (once it's given) <span class="spoiler">never lets go of the pendant</span>. Flirts with composure, but overall rather haggard, and tends to look like she's been crying.

## Addison
Painfully average in most regards, but trying very hard to project otherwise. Later swaps some passive whites in her outit with darker leather, which she thinks makes her look pretty cool, and picks up a pendant necklace while she's at it.

Associated with **orange**, typically brighter.

## Caleb
Timid little guy who's usually sinking into his sweater, pitching a fit, or both. Huge, nervous eyes and a mouth that's always wavering. Clothes drown him in soft pastels; hands are almost always tucked into long sleeves.

Associated with **pink**, usually pale.

## Gary
Big, round, and pretty chill. Besides heterochromia, his palette doesn't stick out; his gregarious attitude is less subtle. Soft varsity jacket is sometimes buttoned up, sometimes open, whatever he feels like.

Associated with **reddish-brown**, more saturated and/or dark than kid!Joce.

## "The accountant"
Very tall, very particular, and not terribly amused by most but rather lively when fixated. Bright-suited with irises to match; white hair is dyed that way. Prone to odd hand movements.

Associated with **aqua**, blue-green, green-blue, whatever you call it; always saturated, but can stand out less in certain lighting.

## Sequitur
Lanky to the point of boniness, hunch-necked, and looks like they just rolled out of bed. Striped sleeves and faded hair tips used to be brighter. Pajama pants and slippers all the way down.

Associated with **indigo**; saturation heavily varies.

## "White Rabbit"
Probably a human being, ignoring the rabbitesque skull-head, and white-rot gnawing at the limbs. Wears a pale yellow t-shirt and a black neck bandana that covers the neck (and above, tucked under the "cheekbone"). Seems self-assured, but doesn't talk.

### human
Didn't, by default, have a trace of white-rot. Perpetual side-eye; rarely made eye contact. A brown hiking vest helps offset the outfit contrast.

## "S."
Pale, languid, and almost always seen with a smoking cigarette. Entirely black and white, donning heavy eyeshadow and hair bleached at the tips. Outfits vary but are just as stark, and often feature heels.
