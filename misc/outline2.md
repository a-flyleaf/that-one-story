    sum: start of story

      - nm: the first
        desc: |-
          Lorem ipsum **dolor sit** amet. For god's sake *keep it short*.
  - title: But you
    sum: |-
      Kay Lin goes off the shits // starts with balcony scene, ends with the Em-sponsored cave-in
    scn:
      - nm: balcony/KL big F moments
        desc: |-
          Kay Lin is *certain* that WR is Em. At first she thought Em just lost her memory, but remembering Sequitur disproves it. KL tries to return the pendant as a "remember me?" gesture. Dead silence. KL's like "at least say *something* :,(" and Em just fuckign,, walks out.
      - nm: aftermath bits
        desc: |-
          Joce overheard the whole thing and immediately goes to confront WR/Em; Em confirms but is like "it's *complicated* I'll tell you more later, don't get involved. You'll make it worse" and the latter convinces Joce.
          
          Meanwhile/later, Sequitur finds KL having a bad time. She's reclusive at first, but gets an Idea, and holds their face close as she says there's a way they can help her feel better.
      - nm: KL hunt
        desc: |-
          Back and forth:
          - "They're gone." Joce wasn't sleeping anyway.
          - Seq's having a cooldown; Kay Lin makes her move. Yes, it's suggestive. She traps them, and outright asks them to kill her. And of course they're like "what the *fuck* no", but she traps them there anyway.
          - Em and Joce fight off rabbits on their pursuit, back-to-back. Em's like "she's fucking crazy" and Joce is like "I *know*," possible backstory snippets with Em's narration? Em has nothing nice to say about KL, Joce is kinda uneasy with that.\*
          - But yeah Seq is bait and KL's getting impatient.
      - nm: collapse
        desc: |-
          Em goes straight to Sequitur; Kay Lin yells at her to zero response. Joce tries to calm her down; "How *nice* of you to stop by" or similar, KL's distressedly mocking her, but isn't Peak Energy the whole time.
          
          Rabbits start closing in; when Joce flees, Kay Lin doesn't follow. Em's silently like "yo don't do it" and Joce tries to rush for her anyway and Em's just ":^/ *oh my god*," then forces a cave-in. Fleeting eye contact, fall to black.
    note: |-
      \*Hmm, not actually 100% sold on the pacing here... a full-out Em!POV flashback seems to kill the pace, but I don't want to pad out the interim. That said this episode goes by wicked fast, and there's a *lot* in the next one, so might shuffle some stuff :Vc  
      +<em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">also</em> maybe the way Em talks about KL echoes Joce on S, Just A Thought... could even straight-up ask like "you ever have a clingy fuck who just wouldn't let go" and Joce is like "8\\". ("Joce on S" as in "how Joce feels about S" but y'know what? hearing the *same* thing S accused *her* of but @KL would ðŸ‘Œ work like a charm too)
  - title: near-end-of-thing
    sum: I am going backwards the episode count might change. anyway this is uhhh, p much the entire climax? Joce wakes up underground and it's the whole Beacon ascent
    scn:
      - nm: alliance search/cold open
        desc: |-
          Em tells the people that KL's gone insane and to go find her. Seq's like "uhhhh idk man." [Initially forgot about this scene tbh, and it *does* seem redundant... need Something for Seq's uneasiness with Em tho, idk.] Short sequence.
          
          This is the last time the intro will be played; final ep just goes straight into it.
      - nm: underground, alone
        desc: |-
          Joce chugs the ~ichor and wakes up to find Kay Lin already gone, but there's a trail. She calls out as she follows, promising no harm. Possible bait-message?
      - nm: aborted alliance
        desc: |-
          When Joce encounters a search party she's initially relieved and happy to join, but quickly backpedals when she learns Em has sent them after Kay Lin (and convinced them that Joce is crazy to be pursuing her). The group is cornered by rabbits; rather than go down or keep fighting with Joce, the group ditches her.
          
          Someone pulls Joce in at the last second.
      - nm: Joce + the accountant
        desc: |-
          The accountant has been traversing the underground since waking up herself, and requests a catch-up talk in exchange for her guidance. Reluctantly Joce complies.
          
          "[Saving her?] From who---herself?" Joce can't answer that. Before parting, the accountant reveals her name (Diana), and Joce asks her who "Terry" was. Diana is *delighted* she remembers: "Terrance is my deadbeat brother." He was handed the world on a silver platter and squandered it all. (Show Joce moving in; Diana's voiceover continues.) Diana never did understand what kept him going---down, that is.
      - nm: Addison goes full rabbit
        desc: |-
          Joce crosses paths with Addison, who's a demented shell of her former self. She's indecisive. Disgusted and saddened, Joce urges her to move on, never give up. Addison seems to comply---and proceeds to dry-drown, transorming into a rabbit. Joce is helpless.
          
          Em intervenes. "I'm here to save you."
      - nm: vs Em tango
        desc: |-
          Em tries to corner Joce both directly and by luring the rabbit around, but Joce insists on ascending. At one point Em almost has her; "This place... these *people* change you." Then the rabbit attacks, Joce pulls Em out of danger, and then escapes herself.
          
          Em has finally been bested. "Do you think you're a fucking hero?!" But Joce doesn't stop.
          
          The rabbit looms. <i>"Em?"</i> Em swings back---and cut, Joce blocking her ears as she leaves the scene.
      - nm: climactic confrontation
        desc: |-
          At the top of the Beacon, Kay Lin asks Joce to "save" her---by finishing what Em started and killing her, for psychological closure if nothing else. White-rot is pretty bad.
          
          Joce refuses, but there's no way to retreat now; they're both going down no matter what. She moves towards Kay Lin and, using a "hug" to catch her off-guard, confiscates the pendant/her weapon.
      - nm: faux-choice?
        desc: |-
          In the only other instance since ep1, the reader might be able to "choose an ending" here. One option has Joce caving and staying with Kay Lin, only to wake up in a repeat of the intro, now wearing the pendant. Just as Kay Lin told her---"This is all there is."
          
          This leads to the second and inevitable option: Joce leaves.
      - nm: The end
        desc: |-
          Joce steps backwards off the Beacon. Kay Lin falls to her knees; a rabbit looms behind her. Cut to black; game over, and Joce slams *quit*.
  - title: end of thing
    sum: the part where it's over
    scn:
      - nm: Joce wakes up again.
        desc: |-
          This time it's the room where she seems to have been physically kept the whole time; no trace of life, maybe surgical instruments around. The exit door is open---but a door opposite that is also cracked open.
      - nm: through the halls
        desc: |-
          Sterile, empty. Implicitly this is Joce's point of view (same aspect ratio?) but she's not shown directly. Follows a noise down to a door ajar; Kay Lin's room is fucked up.
      - nm: Kay Lin wants out
        desc: |-
          Kay Lin gives up; dying doesn't do anything, but she doesn't want to drive anyone else to their end ever again. Magic words are "I want to move on."
      - nm: Joce leaves Kay Lin
        desc: |-
          Kay Lin wakes up, stumbles out, sees something/someone. "Thank you! And... good bye." May or may not show Joce but the scene ends with the exit door closing.
      - nm: "Don't go"
        desc: |-
          Sequitur visits Em, asks if any of this was "worth it." Em insists there was no other choice, she would've never made it (couldn't be trusted?) on her own. Sequitur asks, "You think *I'll* make it?", and starts to walk out. Suddenly a rabbit looms; its teeth read "<em style="text-transform:uppercase;">Don't go</em>."
      - nm: Neighbor + letter
        desc: |-
          Rainy. Joce is outside gardening when the neighbor/housemate returns. Brief exchange like "you're out here in the rain wtf" "it's not that bad." There's another letter from S; implicit agreement that the neighbor tosses it, if they didn't offscreen already. Maybe compost? Might be better to show the Moment of Friendship; full conversation not necessary.
      - nm: Things are better.
        desc: |-
          Not perfect, but better. Specifics not necessary; the poster is gradually crowded by sentimental mementos from new experiences, then taken down entirely. There's still some trace of it, but it's not necessary.
      - nm: Joce lets go.
        desc: |-
          Joce disposes of the letter in some way---drops it off a bridge, composts it? Fade out on the thing dissolving, <i>fin.</i>
