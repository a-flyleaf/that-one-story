ep:
  - title: Relapse
    sum: start of story
    scn:
      - nm: the first
        desc: |-
          Lorem ipsum **dolor sit** amet. For god's sake *keep it short*.
  - title: No one else
    sum: |-
      KL wakes up sad and ends with KL still being sad but for very different reasons. meanwhile Joce does a friendship!
      
      split up the second scene because "keep it short" is not working out lmao, although the last part's choppy anyway...
    scn:
      - nm: world's worst wake-up call
        desc: |-
          Flashback. Two people ascending the Beacon. Smaller one is crying profusely; larger one, in the lead, says things like "you're not making it any easier" and "you *wanted* this, remember?".
          
           Kay Lin is the smaller one, and *really* doesn't want to do this. But with a gentler tone, her friend promises her it'll be okay, and they shut their eyes and count down.
          
          <i>Splash.</i> Kay Lin opens her eyes; cut to the present. When she sees Joce sleeping nearby she starts losing it, which wakes Joce up.
      - nm: KL check-in
        desc: |-
          Joce reveals (also shown in montage) that she and Kay Lin have been taken in by the alliance from day 1, now led by White Rabbit. KL is torn up about having been rescued, especially since Joce is hurt, but can brush it off when Joce asks for the rest of her story.
          
          Kay Lin reiterates that she did *not* kill her friend, Emery: They made it to the end, and since neither wanted to kill the other, they agreed to just wait it out and see what happened. But Em got infected by the white-rot and one morning KL woke up to--- (She doesn't finish, visuals might do it; implicitly, Em tried to kill herself.) So they agreed to a double death instead, at the top of the Beacon---but when KL closed her eyes, Em jumped.
      - nm: KL check-in [cont'd.]
        desc: |-
          End flashback visuals; Kay Lin says she just keeps waking up here, and she's tried warning people and playing along but nothing works. But she thinks something might be different this round (and doesn't seem to strictly like it), because no one's reached out to her first before.
          
          After a weighty silence, Joce gives her something: the pednant. Joce promises to--- KL interrupts, trying to stop her, but Joce insists: she *will* find a way out of here. Kay Lin isn't hopeful, and tells Joce to leave before she loses her composure again.
      - nm: WR check-in
        desc: |-
          Leaving Kay Lin (and Sequitur entering on Joce's heel), Joce reports back to White Rabbit. WR speaks for the first time onscreen (which Joce does not remark on), inviting Joce out to a group activity.
      - nm: teamwork session
        desc: |-
          WR's group (incl. Joce and medic) goes rabbit-hunting. WR shows Joce a technique akin to bullfighting, which WR uses too: as one of the sturdier people here, stand your ground, then let the group close in when the rabbit gets close. It's a hell of a thrill and it *works*.
      - nm: tug-o-war
        desc: |-
          The challenge splits everyone in a tug-o-war to the death. Joce stands opposite WR and KL, and is like "hold on this is stupid why are we doing this, what if we just... *didn't*." At first it doesn't seem like WR will agree (meaning Joce's side loses instantly) but ultimately WR *does* relent.
          
          The setting throws a temper tantrum as "penalty" but everyone makes it out alive anyway. Power of friendship, babey.
      - nm: campfire stories
        desc: |-
          The alliance throws a celebratory "no one died" campfire, and Joce is invited to sit with WR---and Sequitur, who's apparently a childhood friend.
          
          As they banter, Joce invites Kay Lin to join them. (WR leaves shortly after.) Talking about past stuff, Kay Lin mentions having felt aimless before meeting Em. She gets up not long after. [I forgot if something Prompted that, whoops]
      - nm: tfw no KL
        desc: |-
          Joce follows Kay Lin a short ways off. Kay Lin, more quietly confused than anything, recalls a walk she had with Em shortly before they ended up here. Joce is sympathetic but Kay Lin pushes her away.
          
          When Joce returns to their room that night, Kay Lin isn't there.
      - nm: balcony cliffhanger
        desc: |-
          Joce is on the rooftop when she overhears: WR is on the balcony, and enter KL. "Em?"
  - title: But you
    sum: |-
      Kay Lin goes off the shits // starts with balcony scene, ends with the Em-sponsored cave-in
    scn:
      - nm: balcony/KL big F moments
        desc: |-
          Kay Lin is *certain* that WR is Em. At first she thought Em just lost her memory, but remembering Sequitur disproves it. KL tries to return the pendant as a "remember me?" gesture. Dead silence. KL's like "at least say *something* :,(" and Em just fuckign,, walks out.
      - nm: aftermath bits
        desc: |-
          Joce overheard the whole thing and immediately goes to confront WR/Em; Em confirms but is like "it's *complicated* I'll tell you more later, don't get involved. You'll make it worse" and the latter convinces Joce.
          
          Meanwhile/later, Sequitur finds KL having a bad time. She's reclusive at first, but gets an Idea, and holds their face close as she says there's a way they can help her feel better.
      - nm: KL hunt
        desc: |-
          Back and forth:
          - "They're gone." Joce wasn't sleeping anyway.
          - Seq's having a cooldown; Kay Lin makes her move. Yes, it's suggestive. She traps them, and outright asks them to kill her. And of course they're like "what the *fuck* no", but she traps them there anyway.
          - Em and Joce fight off rabbits on their pursuit, back-to-back. Em's like "she's fucking crazy" and Joce is like "I *know*," possible backstory snippets with Em's narration? Em has nothing nice to say about KL, Joce is kinda uneasy with that.\*
          - But yeah Seq is bait and KL's getting impatient.
      - nm: collapse
        desc: |-
          Em goes straight to Sequitur; Kay Lin yells at her to zero response. Joce tries to calm her down; "How *nice* of you to stop by" or similar, KL's distressedly mocking her, but isn't Peak Energy the whole time.
          
          Rabbits start closing in; when Joce flees, Kay Lin doesn't follow. Em's silently like "yo don't do it" and Joce tries to rush for her anyway and Em's just ":^/ *oh my god*," then forces a cave-in. Fleeting eye contact, fall to black.
    note: |-
      \*Hmm, not actually 100% sold on the pacing here... a full-out Em!POV flashback seems to kill the pace, but I don't want to pad out the interim. That said this episode goes by wicked fast, and there's a *lot* in the next one, so might shuffle some stuff :Vc  
      +<em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">also</em> maybe the way Em talks about KL echoes Joce on S, Just A Thought... could even straight-up ask like "you ever have a clingy fuck who just wouldn't let go" and Joce is like "8\\". ("Joce on S" as in "how Joce feels about S" but y'know what? hearing the *same* thing S accused *her* of but @KL would ðŸ‘Œ work like a charm too)
      
      later addition: *oh yeah* the walk, Em's POV of that is sorrrt of lacking? maybe?? definitely don't need to *show* it all again, just add some context---that Em *used* to be more patient with her, that she really wanted Em to meet her family. there was More to that, a lot more.
  - title: near-end-of-thing
    sum: I am going backwards the episode count might change. anyway this is uhhh, p much the entire climax? Joce wakes up underground and it's the whole Beacon ascent
    scn:
      - nm: alliance search/cold open
        desc: |-
          Em tells the people that KL's gone insane and to go find her. Seq's like "uhhhh idk man." [Initially forgot about this scene tbh, and it *does* seem redundant... need Something for Seq's uneasiness with Em tho, idk.] Short sequence.
          
          This is the last time the intro will be played; final ep just goes straight into it.
      - nm: underground, alone
        desc: |-
          Joce chugs the ~ichor and wakes up to find Kay Lin already gone, but there's a trail. She calls out as she follows, promising no harm. Possible bait-message?
      - nm: aborted alliance
        desc: |-
          When Joce encounters a search party she's initially relieved and happy to join, but quickly backpedals when she learns Em has sent them after Kay Lin (and convinced them that Joce is crazy to be pursuing her). The group is cornered by rabbits; rather than go down or keep fighting with Joce, the group ditches her.
          
          Someone pulls Joce in at the last second.
      - nm: Joce + the accountant
        desc: |-
          The accountant has been traversing the underground since waking up herself, and requests a catch-up talk in exchange for her guidance. Reluctantly Joce complies.
          
          "[Saving her?] From who---herself?" Joce can't answer that. Before parting, the accountant reveals her name (Diana), and Joce asks her who "Terry" was. Diana is *delighted* she remembers: "Terrance is my deadbeat brother." He was handed the world on a silver platter and squandered it all. (Show Joce moving in; Diana's voiceover continues.) Diana never did understand what kept him going---down, that is.
      - nm: Addison goes full rabbit
        desc: |-
          Joce crosses paths with Addison, who's a demented shell of her former self. She's indecisive. Disgusted and saddened, Joce urges her to move on, never give up. Addison seems to comply---and proceeds to dry-drown, transorming into a rabbit. Joce is helpless.
          
          Em intervenes. "I'm here to save you."
      - nm: vs Em tango
        desc: |-
          Em tries to corner Joce both directly and by luring the rabbit around, but Joce insists on ascending. At one point Em almost has her; "This place... these *people* change you." Then the rabbit attacks, Joce pulls Em out of danger, and then escapes herself.
          
          Em has finally been bested. "Do you think you're a fucking hero?!" But Joce doesn't stop.
          
          The rabbit looms. <i>"Em?"</i> Em swings back---and cut, Joce blocking her ears as she leaves the scene.
      - nm: climactic confrontation
        desc: |-
          At the top of the Beacon, Kay Lin asks Joce to "save" her---by finishing what Em started and killing her, for psychological closure if nothing else. White-rot is pretty bad.
          
          Joce refuses, but there's no way to retreat now; they're both going down no matter what. She moves towards Kay Lin and, using a "hug" to catch her off-guard, confiscates the pendant/her weapon.
      - nm: faux-choice?
        desc: |-
          In the only other instance since ep1, the reader might be able to "choose an ending" here. One option has Joce caving and staying with Kay Lin, only to wake up in a repeat of the intro, now wearing the pendant. Just as Kay Lin told her---"This is all there is."
          
          This leads to the second and inevitable option: Joce leaves.
      - nm: The end
        desc: |-
          Joce steps backwards off the Beacon. Kay Lin falls to her knees; a rabbit looms behind her. Cut to black; game over, and Joce slams *quit*.
  - title: end of thing
    sum: the part where it's over
    scn:
      - nm: Joce wakes up again.
        desc: |-
          This time it's the room where she seems to have been physically kept the whole time; no trace of life, maybe surgical instruments around. The exit door is open---but a door opposite that is also cracked open.
      - nm: through the halls
        desc: |-
          Sterile, empty. Implicitly this is Joce's point of view (same aspect ratio?) but she's not shown directly. Follows a noise down to a door ajar; Kay Lin's room is fucked up.
      - nm: Kay Lin wants out
        desc: |-
          Kay Lin gives up; dying doesn't do anything, but she doesn't want to drive anyone else to their end ever again. Magic words are "I want to move on."
      - nm: Joce leaves Kay Lin
        desc: |-
          Kay Lin wakes up, stumbles out, sees something/someone. "Thank you! And... good bye." May or may not show Joce but the scene ends with the exit door closing.
      - nm: "Don't go"
        desc: |-
          Sequitur visits Em, asks if any of this was "worth it." Em insists there was no other choice, she would've never made it (couldn't be trusted?) on her own. Sequitur asks, "You think *I'll* make it?", and starts to walk out. Suddenly a rabbit looms; its teeth read "<em style="text-transform:uppercase;">Don't go</em>."
      - nm: Neighbor + letter
        desc: |-
          Rainy. Joce is outside gardening when the neighbor/housemate returns. Brief exchange like "you're out here in the rain wtf" "it's not that bad." There's another letter from S; implicit agreement that the neighbor tosses it, if they didn't offscreen already. Maybe compost? Might be better to show the Moment of Friendship; full conversation not necessary.
      - nm: Things are better.
        desc: |-
          Not perfect, but better. Specifics not necessary; the poster is gradually crowded by sentimental mementos from new experiences, then taken down entirely. There's still some trace of it, but it's not necessary.
      - nm: Joce lets go.
        desc: |-
          Joce disposes of the letter in some way---drops it off a bridge, composts it? Fade out on the thing dissolving, <i>fin.</i>
