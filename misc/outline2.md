  - title: part ??3
    sum: up to The Moment, starts with amogus challenge. huh guess we're still doing 11 parts after all, possible scene shuffling or part-splitting notwithstanding; proooobably no merging. unless I go insane and make a tl;dr of this haha *unless---*
    scn:
      - nm: amogus round 1*
        desc: |-
          The challenge splits players into small groups with one odd one out. Guess the outlier given one (1) clue, if even that, with limited time to talk between anonymous vote elimination rounds. Grand prize: supplies, and lots.
          
          Joce and Kay Lin are first grouped with w-s, Caleb, and a fifth. Caleb immediately accuses Joce of killing Addison; w-s pounces, Kay Lin retorts, Joce is already *way* out of her league. Still, Caleb's out first, and he's innocent so the game continues.
          
          Second round, Joce is targeted for keeping quiet; she awkwardly tries to shift it to the fifth, which *nearly* doesn't work but they blow their cover and it's game.
      - nm: interim
        desc: |-
          Between games, wolf-skull says it's all in good fun, no hard feelings. It's said with a smirk; Joce doesn't trust it one bit. Caleb, meanwhile, is just continuing to talk shit to whoever's closest; Joce pointedly avoids him.
          
          Kay Lin casually asks why Joce didn't scapegoat her. It would've been easy. Joce, startled, doesn't have an answer for this, and the next round begins.
      - nm: round 2
        desc: |-
          The accountant introduces herself prominently. (The rest are randos.) Curiously, the accountant defends Joce (though not as aggressively as Kay Lin); when Joce hesitantly returns the favor, it inadvertently turns into teamwork. Together they turn the other players against each other---but when it's just them standing, the accountant offers a handshake. *Good game.* She was the outlier, and now she's won.
          
          Joce isn't sure what to make of it all. Obviously, she's been played. But it was a damn *good* play.
      - nm: to the casa
        desc: |-
          Kay Lin's out that round too, and they find that Caleb still hasn't shut up. A big guy, Gary, intervenes before it gets too heated, and invites everyone to his place after the challenge. No alliance, just don't hurt anyone and you're good.
          
          Joce doesn't want anything to do with another chaotic group, but people *are* looking at her. She's certainly made no friend of the alliance. Reluctantly Joce decides to keep her head down and follow the crowd, just for now.
      - nm: in ze casa
        desc: |-
          Kay Lin follows Joce quietly the whole time. Still mildly unsettled by the "scapegoat" talk, once they reach the house, Joce tells her to go off and talk to people, figure out if anyone's plotting anything. Joce is going to "investigate" the place, video game-style.
          
          She finds a locked basement door, but the floor's creaky and Joce trips on a board, aggravating the sprain. Before long Kay Lin's at her side, offering to look at it; Joce, mildly embarrassed, brushes her off.
          
          The accountant overhears, too, and announces it's dinnertime. (It is, implicitly, an order.)
      - nm: disaster dinner
        desc: |-
          Caleb's waiting. (Joce may have seen him come in earlier?) He immediately launches into a verbose non-apology to Joce, which quickly veers off into self-pity; she interrupts and says it's fine, which irritates Kay Lin but *does* get Caleb to shut up.
          
          ...Temporarily, anyway. He's happy to drink; Joce doesn't want to touch the stuff, mutters that Kay Lin shouldn't either. Caleb tries to make small talk, which Joce doesn't try at as a rule, and Kay Lin seems miffed by his mere existence. He shifts his full attention to her before long, eventually provoking a snarky response; Joce is kinda just *"Kay Lin."* (admonishing her) and Caleb *jumps* on it--- "Yeah, *Kayla*, why are you so mean to me? :((( You should listen to your girlfriend...."
          
          Kay Lin gets up and *slams* the table; "She is <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">not</em> my---!"; it's partially a cilché gag but she is also genuinely *extremely* pissed about it, as if Caleb had just mocked a dead pet.
          
          In any case it attracts attention; knocked over her drink, too. Silent, awkward beat. Joce gets up and leaves the table.
      - nm: even worse
        desc: |-
          Joce just wants some fresh fucking air. Instead she gets a slurred crowd of partygoers, which soon melts into something not-quite-present. It's a slurry of unwanted closeness and *far* too many drinks, of Joce *specifically* being pushed into it---
          
          Kay Lin finds her pacing out the back, more agitated than usual. Joce almost doesn't register her presence, just wanting to be left alone to calm down; possible exchange where Joce snaps at her verbally? Regardless Kay Lin reaches out without warning and Joce jabs back on instinct. It's more than enough to knock Kay Lin over, finally snapping Joce out of it---and Caleb's in the window, watching.
          
          Snap decision: Joce backs up and leaves.
      - nm: no u-turn allowed
        desc: |-
          The haze is *bad*. Joce tries to convince herself what she's doing is good and necessary, she was getting too attached anyway--- no, Kay Lin was---? It's a futile effort. That looked bad, it *was* bad.
          
          It's also hard to get too far with the sprain acting up. Then some blasts go off nearby, and Joce is being pursued---by Caleb, of all people. Still not sure of the details but he *does* manage to corner her, with non-small help from rocky ground and maybe some lurking rabbits.
      - nm: Caleb threatens Joce
        desc: |-
          Caleb demands an apology---for Addison, duh. But he's also projecting basically all his trauma onto her, going on about how he's here to get stronger so he can stop hiding from people like her, it's a big righteous spiel casting Joce as an irredeemable enemy. Joce is very *capable* of striking back, at this point, but the "that makes you exactly what I think you are" talk is getting to her.
          
          Catching her guard down, Caleb goes for a killing blow---
      - nm: Kay Lin kills Caleb/The Moment™
        desc: |-
          ---and gets his throat slit instead.
          
          Apparently Kay Lin followed, broken glass in tow. After Caleb collapses, barely gargling long before going silent, Kay Lin steps over him and gets *way* too close for comfort. She gestures to her own neck; carotid, takes seconds to bleed out.
          
          Joce can't move.
          
          ~~World's most uncomfortable staring contest ever.~~ (It's not just Joce; Kay Lin doesn't move, either.)
    note: \*god I really did keep the titles short and serious at first and now they are Just. this is what my notes look like these days btw all y'all, it's a trainwreck out here
  - title: part not-4
    sum: after The Moment, Gary's house "arc," and ends with their escort out
    scn:
      - nm: intro speedrun
        desc: |-
          The episode starts with the challenge already underway, with sporadic "flashbacks"/mini-scenes interrupting until up to speed. Joce is trying to focus on the game but having a hell of a time.
      - nm: that just happened
        desc: |-
          The challenge summons seems to "reset" the scene; Kay Lin's suddenly acting fine, and there's no sign of Caleb's body. (Maybe little bits of pendant, though, albeit sunken.) When Kay Lin backs up she's looking down, but Joce barely notices because *what the fuck was that.*
      - nm: actual challenge
        desc: |-
          Joce avoids Kay Lin like the plague. Lots of people are missing from Gary's place, and (in the background? idk if Joce notices) Gary seems surprised to see the accountant, who shows up separately.
          
          The challenge is capture-the-flag meets laser tag except the "lasers" are (nonlethal) jabs to the neck. Joce is on a team with Gary opposite Kay Lin; the accountant's out early. Joce treats it like a first-person shooter and quickly gets into it, but is haunted by Kay Lin. (May or may not be hallucinating via sleep deprivation.)
      - nm: victory(?)
        desc: |-
          The actual Kay Lin is helping Joce from the sidelines the whole time, which does *not* help Joce's paranoia. Near the end, Joce has the chance to claim victory, but it means letting Kay Lin get struck down; Joce goes for the goal anyway, and smashes it as Kay Lin gets hit (by Gary, turns out).
      - nm: Gary's invitation
        desc: |-
          The prize is messages in bottles and Joce starts to walk without taking hers. Gary catches up, congratulating her on the challenge performance and inviting her back to the house. Joce, paranoid and overtired, argues; "You don't know me. You don't know anything about me." But there are rabbits lurking, and she *really* needs sleep, so in the end she relents.
          
          Her head's in a fuzz on the trek back (of which Kay Lin is also a part, barely noticeable), and as soon as she finds a room Joce falls immediately and deeply asleep.
      - nm: good morning
        desc: |-
          Joce wakes up to the bottle on the bedstand; "Someone's looking out for you ;)", plus a note to meet the accountant in her office.
          
          Outside, Joce passes Kay Lin, who's got a noticeable black eye. They make very brief eye contact and then mutually try to ignore it.
      - nm: failed the charisma check
        desc: |-
          Still wary, Joce actually tries to talk to people. Running off would look bad, especially with Kay Lin around, and she wants to figure out what people know about last night, about the accountant.
          
          Unfortunately she is quickly reminded why she doesn't do this: her approach is jarringly direct, which unnerves people, and she stutters and they notice and that makes it worse. It's a very awkward experience on both ends and, after a few revolving rounds of nonsense, Joce is frazzled. (More of a montage than anything detailed.)
      - nm: Joce warns Gary, or at least tries
        desc: |-
          When Joce rounds back by the living room (maybe prompted by the last one she ~talks to?), Gary's talking with Kay Lin, which immediately makes Joce panic. She not-at-all-inconspicuously pulls him aside, trying to warn him that Kay Lin might not be trustworthy, but unable to get out the details. Then she sees Kay Lin's watching and just walks off on the spot.
      - nm: Mistake™
        desc: |-
          By now Joce could use a smoke. Or drink. Or hell, the next best thing: she finds the accountant's office.
          
          The accountant is examining a wall map, and without greeting Joce talks about how baffling it is. Joce hesitantly joins the investigation (the site of last night's events is marked somehow), and (at the accountant's prompting? probably not thinking about it too much, just socially drained) mentions the map seems to "loop" from one end to the other.
          
          The accountant is impressed. Joce is weirdly flattered. Then enter Gary.
      - nm: <em>Big</em> Mistake
        desc: |-
          He trails off when he notices Joce, not even finishing the sentence. He doesn't have to; the accountant instantly deducts they've talked, and further guess-asks if it's about *that girl.* The lack of response is immediately damning.
          
          Joce blurts "Don't hurt her---!" but the accountant is *delighted.* She's noticed Caleb went missing, of course, as did these two, and frankly she doesn't think Joce could hurt a fly. What's the agreement on people who break rule #1 (play nice), eh, Gary? Is it lethal?
          
          Garys is apologetically pushing back; Joce takes the first excuse to bolt.
      - nm: oh <em>now</em> you don’t want to—
        desc: |-
          Joce tells Kay Lin they gotta go, *now*, and tries to drag her out; she resists, and people notice. Increasingly panicked, Joce tries to argue, which makes her look worse. Gary steps in to break up the brewing fight, and pulls both Joce *and* Kay Lin aside.
      - nm: T.T.F.N.
        desc: |-
          Gary's actually willing to let them go, because he thinks Joce is good people and Kay Lin... well, she's probably fine. Kay Lin asks about Joce's bottle (confirming she brought it along in the first place); the accountant hands it over, having watched from close behind; it all happens quickly.
          
          Surprisingly, the accountant agrees to let them go, though she's still treating the whole thing like a very funny show. And just like that, Joce and Kay Lin are out free---back into the wild world of broken ground and rabbit monsters.
  - title: part not-5
    sum: |-
      starts with J/KL argument, ends with Gary's downfall and hand hold. might be shorter since it's getting late whoops  
      +for whatever it's worth, inadvertently started writing start to finish here
    scn:
      - nm: you did What
        desc: |-
          Kay Lin has *questions*---and vice versa. Joce admits she accidentally indicated to the accountant that Kay Lin had killed Caleb, but also, *what the fuck even was any of that.* Kay Lin just doubles down on Joce being condescending, and not too open herself.
      - nm: rabbit time
        desc: |-
          The argument attracts a rabbit, forcing Joce and Kay Lin to work together despite their disagreements. They're still talking as they go, and realize they have the unfortunate common ground of "why are you still with me, I can't believe anyone would want to stay."
      - nm: aftermath
        desc: |-
          Once things settle, Kay Lin offers a handshake; "Here's to being fucked up." Joce hesitates; she'd... really prefer not to be. But they don't split.
          
          They decide to take refuge in the rabbit's crevice. Passing its melted body, Joce muses aloud she feels bad for the things. She might not say it aloud, but she remembers the necklace on the fallen, and what she saw of the first rabbit.
      - nm: too good to be true
        desc: |-
          It's quiet as they settle in. But they haven't lost the bottle because of course not, and overnight, Joce gets up to get rid of it. ---Except she can't make herself do it.
          
          Enter Gary, who just wanted to check in. He mentions what's been happening at the house since, says he feels bad for how it turned out.
      - nm: that damned letter
        desc: |-
          When Gary notices the bottle, Joce hesitantly mentions it's from someone she used to know, but not in a good way. Gary suggests she just read it, get it over with. If she already knows what it's gonna say, what's the harm?
          
          It's not the "bb take me back" Joce expected---it's a scathing indictment of her every character flaw, essentially deeming her a dysfunctional waste of time. (There should be truth to it, mind, not *all* dramatic put-downs.) Joce ~literally sees red, even as she feels backed against a wall.
      - nm: rabbit attack
        desc: |-
          Gary snaps her out of it; rabbits are closing in. They try to fight back but don't get far; only Gary is armed.
          
          But they could always trap the damn things. Gary offers a diversion while Joce gets in position; she hesitates, but he offers an assurring thumbs-up and a wink, and he's framed all heroic with the bat raised.
          
          Pull trigger; cut scene.
      - nm: hand hold
        desc: |-
          The cavern has indeed collapsed upon itself. Kay Lin is woken by the rumble and finds Joce standing in the center, blank.
          
          Kay Lin holds her hand; Joce barely noticed her wading in. All is silent. End episode.
  - title: So it goes
    sum: looootsa flashbacks in this one. like I think this is 90% flashback, with a little KL/Seq between and then Gary at the end. RIP Gary.

      - nm: pre-intro, KL+J?
        desc: |-
          Joce has sprained her ankle again. Kay Lin urges her to exercise it. Joce obeys, but is otherwise despondent, which worries Kay Lin thoroughly.
      - nm: childhood flashback, expanded edition
        desc: |-
          As a kid/young teen, Joce had finally made a "friend" (or at least gotten someone to listen) and was telling them about the impending end of the world. Playing catch or tetherball as this happens; ends with the other one not buying it (maybe the whole thing being a setup to embarrass Joce?), and Joce hits the ball so hard it flies over the fence and smashes some not-too-distant glass. Other kids scramble as the car alarm blares. (Resembles the Beacon sound.)
      - nm: childhood flashback, cont'd.
        desc: |-
          [thinking of interspersing things here but for plotting clarity I just keep going in order with no interruptions]
          
          The car owner has shoved "S" against an alley wall, pissed. Joce, wielding a baseball bat, interrupts, voice shaking but trying to stand strong. Although the adult is intimidating, the arrival of another adult (teacher?) dissipates the tension.
          
          Unsure if Joce and "S" talk here or later, but Joce is like "stop standing around the schoolgrounds you fucking creep" and S is all amused by that, which Joce isn't sure what to make of. They call her a "little hero" and gift her a dog tag chain necklace as thanks.
      - nm: teen flashback
        desc: |-
          [definitely needs some kind of Thing between last part and this. oh yeah, and order may not be chronological]
          
          Joce has continued to meet with S. into her mid-teens. They meet secretly on a rooftop for a smoke (S. offers, Joce lights up; still not 100% used to it, but not *un*willing), where Joce bemoans the usual bullshit. Shifting the topic, she teases S over the latest "boytoy," but it turns out that guy dumped S too; Joce awkwardly apologizes, S is like "eh, they all do."
          
          S. proposes Joce come live with. Do well in school, keep the record clean---then move out soon as she's legally able, when they can't raise a stink. Joce can't believe it. She's not saying *no.*
      - nm: "flashback: proposal"
        desc: |-
          Dingy (though not claustrophobic) living space, trash and clothes strewn about, yellowing walls. TV's on. Dramatic scene of the hero (same guy as Joce's childhood franchise) being all "my love, I can't" but the woman insists, and for bullshit plot reasons he impales her through the gut and shoves her off a cliff.
          
          Joce, now a young adult, is jeering; very drunk, leaning on S. Mockery like this is a pastime, though S. isn't enthusiastic about it as they usually are. This is stupid, isn't it? No, like---*very* stupid. As in, not worth their time anymore. Joce falls silent.\* S doesn't apologize, kinda just handwaves it; she shouldn't be so attached anyway.
          
          Actually, Joce feels kinda sick. Hangover kicking in, maybe. Then, out of nowhere: "Let's get married." Beat. Joce promptly throws up. (S: "You could have used words...")
      - nm: beginning of the end
        desc: |-
          Abrupt interruption from Kay Lin. (Was faintly visible in the background smog previously, but only barely. She's been *trying* to get through to Joce without much luck; this might seem abrupt, even disproportionate, which is intentional.) Kay Lin is fed up with Joce, rants about feeling like she's talking to a brick wall; it doesn't persuade Joce much.
          
          Kay Lin "threatens" to walk out; no response from Joce. It's dangerous out there. She might not come back. Joce kinda just eyes her dryly. Deflating, Kay Lin pauses at the exit, but ultimately walks.
          
          Parallel-cuts to Joce in the next flashback:
      - nm: beginning of the end pt. 2
        desc: |-
          ~Younger Joce sits on a couch, just as blank. A "game over" screen flashes at her. (Setting is vaguely similar to the story environment.) She hears the door open and immediately perks up, is like "Hey, I heard there was gonna be a concert at---" People are talking.
          
          She stops dead in the doorway. Someone's come in with Sal and they're making out *right there,* barely acknowledging her. When they *do* it's a "oh, never mind her, she just lives here" handwave, a giggle, and they're back to flirting and they're going up to bed.
          
          Joce can't move.
          
          Montage of Sal apologizing, holding her, giving her the cold shoulder, with another lover, staying close, teasing, mocking, and she's still not moving.
      - nm: meanwhile...
        desc: |-
          Unsure if KL's outing with Sequitur should be shown, but she comes back very, *very* giddy. Definitely *talks* about having met them and thinking they were weird but in kind of a fun way, and Joce kinda just tunes it out. *Maybe* makes some kind of cold jab?
          
          In either case, Kay Lin just quietly lies down against her, defeated and suddenly very quiet. Maybe says something like "I just want to help. You're making it so difficult." It's more sad than anything.
      - nm: last but not least...
        desc: |-
          [It's dawning on me this part is *really fucking long* and might warrant splitting... but then Where.... Maybe it just seems longer since I'm being more generous with the descriptions? For now I digress.]
          
          [also unsure how these parts are paced but EH here goes:]
          
          Kay Lin: Out again. But instead of Sequitur, she finds a dead end. / Joce: Kay Lin's been out too long. Finally she gets up to find her.
          
          Also meanwhile the flashback is of Joce finally walking out; unsure where it cuts off, but it'll continue into the next episode.
      - nm: parallel disaster
        desc: |-
          The accountant, wielding the pendant, corners Kay Lin and convinces her to follow quietly. (She threatens to sic people on Joce; they left the house on such a godawful note, it would not be hard.) When Kay Lin walks out the accountant takes her hand in a vicegrip.
          
          Joce ventures back underground and hears something---Gary. But he's *different* now, bloated, groaning, *wrong.* If he recognizes Joce it's hard to tell.
          
          Kay Lin is led to a back entry and nudged in. She tries to make a run for it, but the accountant is faster. Joce is cornered by Gary and, desperate, triggers a cave-in. The scenes go black in parallel.
      - nm: goodbye
        desc: |-
          ok maybe flashback!Joce walks out here??
          
          Rubble. It's dark. Joce leaves, visibly and deeply shaken; Gary's been let behind. Did he recognize her, in the end? Unsure how sapient I want him to be, but Joce feels fucking awful (worse, even) either way.
          
          But Kay Lin's still gone. She steels her resolve. End episode.
    note: \*ngl I actually forgot how this scene goes, just that it involved TV and ended with the proposal. this works though I think

          Before Joce leaves, she pauses and apologizes. Seq's like "for what"; it's for threatening them at the beginning, for the $food. Sequitur doesn't remember, and doesn't think it's a big deal anyway, which Gets To her a bit. Joce walks off hastily.

          Meanwhile, the accountant steps out and starts interrogating Kay Lin. Kay Lin's not too worried, maybe crack some jokes ("Gee, you could've asked me to dinner first"). As Joce gets closer to the muffled voices, cue "I know you've won" talk.
          
          Kay Lin still refuses to answer for real, and then Joce drops in. The accountant traps her instantly and Kay Lin *flips*.
      - nm: revelation time
        desc: |-
          The accountant reveals she doesn't *want* to hurt either of them (terribly inconvenient) but figured this might be the only way to make Kay Lin talk. Possible reiteration of *how* she knows Kay Lin's a former victor, which Kay Lin reluctantly confirms. Also drop the pendant if it hasn't been already. Joce starts out defiant but can't deny that she wants to know what's going on, too.
          
          Thus the accountant, still very much teasing Kay Lin (and a frustrated Kay Lin very much *not* reciprocating), pushes for more, and when Joce is threatened (hurt?) she caves: Yes, she's won this game beore. She first played with a friend---that pendant was hers.
      - nm: revelations cont'd.
        desc: |-
          No more from Kay Lin. The accountant *jumps* on this; Kay Lin, increasingly distraught, insists she did *not* kill her friend, but refuses to say how she (the friend) died.
          
          The accountant nudges Joce along to a conclusion, with or without stating it outright. (Think less manipulation more "can you believe this shit, she's *clearly* using you"; blatant or not, Kay Lin's out of denials.) Asks Joce: "Do I... remind you of her?" Kay Lin can only say, feebly, "Yeah. You do." and then drops her head.
      - nm: aftermath
        desc: |-
          Possible resumed flashback? Back-and-forths; makes Joce sound like a real hardass (do whatever it takes to survive), but culminates in what she *really* wants (to protect the weak, because no one was there for her).
          
          The accountant's like "alright, we're done here" and offers to let Joce go, or maybe straight-up *does* with no warning. She quickly proves her reflexes beat Joce's, but otherwise she's willing to let Joce go free, provided she leaves alone.
          
          At first Joce actually seems to go for it. The accountant kneels down by Kay Lin, disappointed in the sentimental anticlimax, requesting last words and such. Silence from Kay Lin. Joce breaks in and raises a lamp over the accountant's head--- ! (possible challenge summons at the end?)
      - nm: quote-unquote “heroism”, Vulnerable Moment
        desc: |-
          Conclude flashback/motive sequence.
          
          Joce runs out as the house collapses. She's carrying Kay Lin, who's unconscious and bleeding profusely from a torso wound. In sharp contrast to the quiet, noble hero image, Joce is thoroughly panicked.
          
          She catches sight of an alliance group; unsure if she caves to calling for help or if they notice, but White Rabbit steps forward and Joce is still reluctant to let Kay Lin go.
          
          When she does, the adrenaline crashes as people (including a medic) surround Kay Lin, blocking her from sight. Sequitur approaches Joce and offers a comforting back/shoulder pat; Joce kneels, quietly falling apart.
  - title: No one else
    sum: |-
      KL wakes up sad and ends with KL still being sad but for very different reasons. meanwhile Joce does a friendship!
      
      split up the second scene because "keep it short" is not working out lmao, although the last part's choppy anyway...
      
      +later note: wondering if there could also be a bit more with Joce and the medic? Joce hit her own little nadir last ep, but I don't want to spend too much time on a minor relationship.... working it into the group session could be fine ig, hm.
    scn:
      - nm: world's worst wake-up call
        desc: |-
          Flashback. Two people ascending the Beacon. Smaller one is crying profusely; larger one, in the lead, says things like "you're not making it any easier" and "you *wanted* this, remember?".
          
           Kay Lin is the smaller one, and *really* doesn't want to do this. But with a gentler tone, her friend promises her it'll be okay, and they shut their eyes and count down.
          
          <i>Splash.</i> Kay Lin opens her eyes; cut to the present. When she sees Joce sleeping nearby she starts losing it, which wakes Joce up.
      - nm: KL check-in
        desc: |-
          Joce reveals (also shown in montage) that she and Kay Lin have been taken in by the alliance from day 1, now led by White Rabbit. KL is torn up about having been rescued, especially since Joce is hurt, but can brush it off when Joce asks for the rest of her story.
          
          Kay Lin reiterates that she did *not* kill her friend, Emery: They made it to the end, and since neither wanted to kill the other, they agreed to just wait it out and see what happened. But Em got infected by the white-rot and one morning KL woke up to--- (She doesn't finish, visuals might do it; implicitly, Em tried to kill herself.) So they agreed to a double death instead, at the top of the Beacon---but when KL closed her eyes, Em jumped.
      - nm: KL check-in [cont'd.]
        desc: |-
          End flashback visuals; Kay Lin says she just keeps waking up here, and she's tried warning people and playing along but nothing works. But she thinks something might be different this round (and doesn't seem to strictly like it), because no one's reached out to her first before.
          
          After a weighty silence, Joce gives her something: the pednant. Joce promises to--- KL interrupts, trying to stop her, but Joce insists: she *will* find a way out of here. Kay Lin isn't hopeful, and tells Joce to leave before she loses her composure again.
      - nm: WR check-in
        desc: |-
          Leaving Kay Lin (and Sequitur entering on Joce's heel), Joce reports back to White Rabbit. WR speaks for the first time onscreen (which Joce does not remark on), inviting Joce out to a group activity.
      - nm: teamwork session
        desc: |-
          WR's group (incl. Joce and medic) goes rabbit-hunting. WR shows Joce a technique akin to bullfighting, which WR uses too: as one of the sturdier people here, stand your ground, then let the group close in when the rabbit gets close. It's a hell of a thrill and it *works*.
      - nm: tug-o-war
        desc: |-
          The challenge splits everyone in a tug-o-war to the death. Joce stands opposite WR and KL, and is like "hold on this is stupid why are we doing this, what if we just... *didn't*." At first it doesn't seem like WR will agree (meaning Joce's side loses instantly) but ultimately WR *does* relent.
          
          The setting throws a temper tantrum as "penalty" but everyone makes it out alive anyway. Power of friendship, babey.
      - nm: campfire stories
        desc: |-
          The alliance throws a celebratory "no one died" campfire, and Joce is invited to sit with WR---and Sequitur, who's apparently a childhood friend.
          
          As they banter, Joce invites Kay Lin to join them. (WR leaves shortly after.) Talking about past stuff, Kay Lin mentions having felt aimless before meeting Em. She gets up not long after. [I forgot if something Prompted that, whoops]
      - nm: tfw no KL
        desc: |-
          Joce follows Kay Lin a short ways off. Kay Lin, more quietly confused than anything, recalls a walk she had with Em shortly before they ended up here. Joce is sympathetic but Kay Lin pushes her away.
          
          When Joce returns to their room that night, Kay Lin isn't there.
      - nm: balcony cliffhanger
        desc: |-
          Joce is on the rooftop when she overhears: WR is on the balcony, and enter KL. "Em?"
  - title: But you
    sum: |-
      Kay Lin goes off the shits // starts with balcony scene, ends with the Em-sponsored cave-in
    scn:
      - nm: balcony/KL big F moments
        desc: |-
          Kay Lin is *certain* that WR is Em. At first she thought Em just lost her memory, but remembering Sequitur disproves it. KL tries to return the pendant as a "remember me?" gesture. Dead silence. KL's like "at least say *something* :,(" and Em just fuckign,, walks out.
      - nm: aftermath bits
        desc: |-
          Joce overheard the whole thing and immediately goes to confront WR/Em; Em confirms but is like "it's *complicated* I'll tell you more later, don't get involved. You'll make it worse" and the latter convinces Joce.
          
          Meanwhile/later, Sequitur finds KL having a bad time. She's reclusive at first, but gets an Idea, and holds their face close as she says there's a way they can help her feel better.
      - nm: KL hunt
        desc: |-
          Back and forth:
          - "They're gone." Joce wasn't sleeping anyway.
          - Seq's having a cooldown; Kay Lin makes her move. Yes, it's suggestive. She traps them, and outright asks them to kill her. And of course they're like "what the *fuck* no", but she traps them there anyway.
          - Em and Joce fight off rabbits on their pursuit, back-to-back. Em's like "she's fucking crazy" and Joce is like "I *know*," possible backstory snippets with Em's narration? Em has nothing nice to say about KL, Joce is kinda uneasy with that.\*
          - But yeah Seq is bait and KL's getting impatient.
      - nm: collapse
        desc: |-
          Em goes straight to Sequitur; Kay Lin yells at her to zero response. Joce tries to calm her down; "How *nice* of you to stop by" or similar, KL's distressedly mocking her, but isn't Peak Energy the whole time.
          
          Rabbits start closing in; when Joce flees, Kay Lin doesn't follow. Em's silently like "yo don't do it" and Joce tries to rush for her anyway and Em's just ":^/ *oh my god*," then forces a cave-in. Fleeting eye contact, fall to black.
    note: |-
      \*Hmm, not actually 100% sold on the pacing here... a full-out Em!POV flashback seems to kill the pace, but I don't want to pad out the interim. That said this episode goes by wicked fast, and there's a *lot* in the next one, so might shuffle some stuff :Vc  
      +<em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">also</em> maybe the way Em talks about KL echoes Joce on S, Just A Thought... could even straight-up ask like "you ever have a clingy fuck who just wouldn't let go" and Joce is like "8\\". ("Joce on S" as in "how Joce feels about S" but y'know what? hearing the *same* thing S accused *her* of but @KL would 👌 work like a charm too)
      
      later addition: *oh yeah* the walk, Em's POV of that is sorrrt of lacking? maybe?? definitely don't need to *show* it all again, just add some context---that Em *used* to be more patient with her, that she really wanted Em to meet her family. there was More to that, a lot more.
      
      later *later* addition: maybe Joce waking up can get moved to the end here? we *know* she's not getting killed off here, it's not really a cliffhanger. also seems like more time passes between that and the alliance encounter, with WR's declaration sandwiched between.
  - title: near-end-of-thing
    sum: I am going backwards the episode count might change. anyway this is uhhh, p much the entire climax? Joce wakes up underground and it's the whole Beacon ascent
    scn:
      - nm: alliance search/cold open
        desc: |-
          Em tells the people that KL's gone insane and to go find her. Seq's like "uhhhh idk man." [Initially forgot about this scene tbh, and it *does* seem redundant... need Something for Seq's uneasiness with Em tho, idk.] Short sequence.
          
          This is the last time the intro will be played; final ep just goes straight into it.
      - nm: underground, alone
        desc: |-
          Joce chugs the ~ichor and wakes up to find Kay Lin already gone, but there's a trail. She calls out as she follows, promising no harm. Possible bait-message?
      - nm: aborted alliance
        desc: |-
          When Joce encounters a search party she's initially relieved and happy to join, but quickly backpedals when she learns Em has sent them after Kay Lin (and convinced them that Joce is crazy to be pursuing her). The group is cornered by rabbits; rather than go down or keep fighting with Joce, the group ditches her.
          
          Someone pulls Joce in at the last second.
      - nm: Joce + the accountant
        desc: |-
          The accountant has been traversing the underground since waking up herself, and requests a catch-up talk in exchange for her guidance. Reluctantly Joce complies.
          
          "[Saving her?] From who---herself?" Joce can't answer that. (Also something something Joce is drawn to people who are bad for her, maybe too obvious but if anyone's gonna say it it's the accountant here.) Before parting, the accountant reveals her name (Diana), and Joce asks her who "Terry" was. Diana is *delighted* she remembers: "Terrance is my deadbeat brother." He was handed the world on a silver platter and squandered it all. (Show Joce moving in; Diana's voiceover continues.) Diana never did understand what kept him going---down, that is.
      - nm: Addison goes full rabbit
        desc: |-
          Joce crosses paths with Addison, who's a demented shell of her former self. She's indecisive. Disgusted and saddened, Joce urges her to move on, never give up. Addison seems to comply---and proceeds to dry-drown, transorming into a rabbit. Joce is helpless.
          
          Em intervenes. "I'm here to save you."
      - nm: vs Em tango
        desc: |-
          Em tries to corner Joce both directly and by luring the rabbit around, but Joce insists on ascending. At one point Em almost has her; "This place... these *people* change you." Then the rabbit attacks, Joce pulls Em out of danger, and then escapes herself.
          
          Em has finally been bested. "Do you think you're a fucking hero?!" But Joce doesn't stop.
          
          The rabbit looms. <i>"Em?"</i> Em swings back---and cut, Joce blocking her ears as she leaves the scene.
      - nm: climactic confrontation
        desc: |-
          At the top of the Beacon, Kay Lin asks Joce to "save" her---by finishing what Em started and killing her, for psychological closure if nothing else. White-rot is pretty bad.
          
          Joce refuses, but there's no way to retreat now; they're both going down no matter what. She moves towards Kay Lin and, using a "hug" to catch her off-guard, confiscates the pendant/her weapon.
      - nm: faux-choice?
        desc: |-
          In the only other instance since ep1, the reader might be able to "choose an ending" here. One option has Joce caving and staying with Kay Lin, only to wake up in a repeat of the intro, now wearing the pendant. Just as Kay Lin told her---"This is all there is."
          
          This leads to the second and inevitable option: Joce leaves.
      - nm: The end
        desc: |-
          Joce steps backwards off the Beacon. Kay Lin falls to her knees; a rabbit looms behind her. Cut to black; game over, and Joce slams *quit*.
  - title: end of thing
    sum: the part where it's over
    scn:
      - nm: Joce wakes up again.
        desc: |-
          This time it's the room where she seems to have been physically kept the whole time; no trace of life, maybe surgical instruments around. The exit door is open---but a door opposite that is also cracked open.
      - nm: through the halls
        desc: |-
          Sterile, empty. Implicitly this is Joce's point of view (same aspect ratio?) but she's not shown directly. Follows a noise down to a door ajar; Kay Lin's room is fucked up.
      - nm: Kay Lin wants out
        desc: |-
          Kay Lin gives up; dying doesn't do anything, but she doesn't want to drive anyone else to their end ever again. Magic words are "I want to move on."
      - nm: Joce leaves Kay Lin
        desc: |-
          Kay Lin wakes up, stumbles out, sees something/someone. "Thank you! And... good bye." May or may not show Joce but the scene ends with the exit door closing.
      - nm: "Don't go"
        desc: |-
          Sequitur visits Em, asks if any of this was "worth it." Em insists there was no other choice, she would've never made it (couldn't be trusted?) on her own. Sequitur asks, "You think *I'll* make it?", and starts to walk out. Suddenly a rabbit looms; its teeth read "<em style="text-transform:uppercase;">Don't go</em>."
      - nm: Neighbor + letter
        desc: |-
          Rainy. Joce is outside gardening when the neighbor/housemate returns. Brief exchange like "you're out here in the rain wtf" "it's not that bad." There's another letter from S; implicit agreement that the neighbor tosses it, if they didn't offscreen already. Maybe compost? Might be better to show the Moment of Friendship; full conversation not necessary.
      - nm: Things are better.
        desc: |-
          Not perfect, but better. Specifics not necessary; the poster is gradually crowded by sentimental mementos from new experiences, then taken down entirely. There's still some trace of it, but it's not necessary.
      - nm: Joce lets go.
        desc: |-
          Joce disposes of the letter in some way---drops it off a bridge, composts it? Fade out on the thing dissolving, <i>fin.</i>
