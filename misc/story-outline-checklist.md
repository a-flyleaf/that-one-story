    - prt: |-
        locked: flashback (lockout); KL cornered → J finds G → KL K-O'd → J triggers cave-in
        - imagining a tight back-and-forth here, not sure how the page division will go
  - title: "07: Despite everything"
    scn:
    - prt: "intro/alone: KL wakeup"
    - prt: "oddly-threatening: J+Sq → KL still alone"
    - prt: "liar: D reveal & banter, J crashes in →  KL confessional → “...Yeah. You do.”"

  - title: "08: No one else"
    scn:
    - prt: |-
        intro/no: KL+E Beacon flashback → KL wakes up
        - “no” is redundant but idk what else to call this; “nonononono” is silly out of context & annoying to remember
    - prt: "promise: J+KL catchup → J returns pendant, “Don't make promises you can't keep.” → J leaves, voiceover into J+WR"
    - prt: "stronger: alliance outing → challenge split, panic → WR complies, celebration"
    - prt: "jubilant: campfire talk, KL off → KL pendant/rabbit story → J+KL sendoff/J suggestion"

    - prt: "(no title sequence?)"

    - prt: "suffocating: KL>Sq threat → J+WR trackdown, E's perspective"

  - title: "10: You can't save her"
    scn:
    - prt: "intro/again: Sq+WR → J wakes up, trail"
    - prt: "following: J loses trail, finds alliance → filled in, rabbits → left, pulled back in → D says hello"
    - prt: |-
        "idly: WR out? → D+J motive interrogation---“From what? Herself?”"
        - not sure on title; thoughtless, autopilot, something to the effect of "just acting on instinct, not seriously considering the ramifications." not quite *careless* ~~carless lol~~ though, it's more subconscious
    - prt: "persist: D+J voiceover/fade, J spiraling up; “Terrance is my deadbeat brother” → A → A pathetic, “You can't give up now” → mistake.jpg → enter WR"
    - prt: "savior: “I'm here to save you,” J refuses → chasedown tango “This place... these *people* change you.” → WR nearly kiled, J leaves; rabbit-smash, “Do you think you're a fucking hero?”"
    - prt: |-
        "apex: KL's been waiting → goal reveal (confirmation?), heroism taunting → J doesn't, KL threatens → J assesses → hug"
        - kinda eh on the title but "peak" doesn't Sound right, "climax" is too on-the-nose
    - prt: "fall: pendant toss, sorry → J leaves"
  - title: "11: I miss you"
    scn:
    - prt: "(no intro?)"
    - prt: |-
        "awake: J rises, observes room → down the hall → door ajar"
        - “rises, observes room” is such dry-ass phrasing but I know what I'm referring to and That's What Matters(TM)
    - prt: "release: there she is → as J works, KL wants out → bright, wake up → alone; “Thank you...! And... good bye.”"
    - prt: "choice: Sq+WR, “Was this worth it?”, “You think I'll make it?” → “DON'T GO”"
    - prt: "neighbor ← that scene"
    - prt: "anew: sendoff montage/letter, fade to black"

I mean, if I *gotta* get fancy with the front matter to make checkboxes look nicer, might as *well* make it a full-fledged page---

## side notes
- "intro/" = "cold open", title sequence after; else, assume title is at the very start (unless otherwise noted)
- scene titles are mainly for URL purposes, may or may not have "chapter" titles. ~~not using numbers in case scenes get shuffled; much easier to relink folders/indexes~~ *nah* just gonna suffer, names are more trouble to change
- arrows (→) indicate a new webpage (of the hypothetical full thing, not necessarily the colorscript)
