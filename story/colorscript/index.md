> [The colorscript gives] a sense of not only what the sequences will look like, but what they should feel like too emotionally, just with pure abstract shapes and color. You know, the way you might read sheet music.
> 
> When I was working on actual shots, I would refer to these ... [to] always remind myself of what these scenes had to be <a href="https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/192/2575" class="ext">at the bare essence, without getting caught up in all of the details</a>.

The full story in color blocks, but more up-to-date than [the 2021 version]({%include url.html%}/gallery/colorscript).

Reads from top left, right, then down a row, like a very long comic strip.

## quicknotes
- The layout is coded using pixel measurements, including font size; think of it more like a giant image than a responsive webpage, as it **will not** resize to fit your browser.
- Best read by viewing one row at a time, but you can toggle a fullsize layout with the checkbox. (Requires light JavaScript.) \[TBA]

Initially drawn between February and June 2022. The first episode was expanded in August 2022, with more scene detail & occasional text; the rest will probably be published as-is, without further editing or expansion. The story's changed since, and as of writing (January 2023) I've [toyed with]({%include url.html%}/au) a similar but disparate way of laying it all out....
