> [The colorscript gives] a sense of not only what the sequences will look like, but what they should feel like too emotionally, just with pure abstract shapes and color. You know, the way you might read sheet music.
> 
> When I was working on actual shots, I would refer to these ... [to] always remind myself of what these scenes had to be <a href="https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/192/2575" class="ext">at the bare essence, without getting caught up in all of the details</a>.

Reads from top left, right, then down a row, like a very long comic strip.

{%include figure.html img="colorscript" alt="Screenshot of a colorscript row, including the next arrow at the end."%}

## technical notes
- The page does *not* scale to fit your browser. For best reading, resize your viewing window so **at least one image** can fit horizontally onscreen at a time.
	- Ideally you can only see **one row at a time**, too. (Theoretically this could be forced via page layout, debating whether or not to actually commit....)
		- ok note to self: as a reading experience I like the contained look a LOT more, guarantees no early-visibility spoilerage and just feels more like a movie. but for *making* the thing this sucks absolute ass and the full page is highly preferrable :V
	- OK THIS CAN BE A TOGGLE NOW YAY
- Coded with pixel measurements, including font size, and subsequently behaves more like a PDF than a responsive webpage.

## the actual colorscripts
