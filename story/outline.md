<!--for my own reference; not supposed to be publically-accessible, but then again neither was the "beta" stuff. so uh, have at it if you want?

"intro/" = "cold open", title sequence after; else, assume title is at the very start (unless otherwise noted)
scene titles are mainly for URL purposes, may or may not have "chapter" titles. not using numbers in case scenes get shuffled; much easier to relink folders/indexes

# 01: Relapse
- intro/wakeup: <--; wordless?
- static: backstory montage ("My hero~") (→ irl?)
- hollow: irl, fade to underground → callout x2 combo → apple
- yours: J+Kl first impressions
- challenge1: "No one has to die, right?" → up, panic ("Terry") → u-turn → escape
- out: J+KL leave, WR rises
- wrong-choice: J+KL talk → rabbit, gameover → null → J confronts KL
- deal1: WR joins the alliance
- together: J+KL evening

# 02: Follow me
- intro/deal2: camp → A>WR proposal
- start-over: J+KR trek, A+alliance? → Beacon meetup → rabbits interrupt → outta there
- listen: J+KL followup → alliance mockery, speech failure → A underground → monologue, "someone worth saving;" C
- left-behind: A+C talk → pendant → cave-in
- challenge2: loud

# 03: Not her
- challenge2: groups → entire game?
- scapegoat: interim → round2 → C accusations, G steps in
- watching: J/KL sendoff → J investigation, trip+fall
- dinner: C fauxpology → awkward, "Yeah, Kayla" etc. → spill
- slurry: <-- all that noise
- cornered: J+KL outside → J self-justification → C chasedown → C kill → KL has no personal space

# 04: Lie in it
- error: game/catchup → victory
- unsolicited: prizes, J "leaves" → G invitation → J crashes
- stutter: wakeup, bottle → failure to interact → G+KL, panic → J warning/admission
- found: J+D map talk, enter G → "Don't hurt her--"
- target: J>KL not-escape → near-fight → G sendoff

# 05: Desperately safe
- neurosis: J+KL argue/rabbit attack → recognition
- kindred: success → reconciliation, "Here's to being fucked up." → alas poor rabbit, shelter get
- too-close: J dissatisfied, sneaks out → quiet underground → G talk → letter → rabbits → cave-in → hand hold

# 06: So it goes
- intro/trying: despondent exercise
- haze: flashback x3 combo (meeting, smoke, proposal), scarce KL → KL snaps/returns/?out flashbacks (cheating, initial & montage)
- locked: flashback (lockout); KL cornered → J finds G → KL K-O'd → J triggers cave-in
	- imagining a tight back-and-forth here, not sure how the page division will go

# 07: Despite everything
- intro/alone: KL wakeup
- oddly-threatening: J+Sq → KL still alone
- liar: D reveal & banter, J crashes in →  KL confessional → "...Yeah. You do."
- and-yet: J (fake)out, D disappointed → double K-O → escape, monologue/hero sequence (flashback end)
- exposed: alliance, vulnerable moment

# 08: No one else
- intro/no: KL+E Beacon flashback → KL wakes up
	- "no" is redundant but idk what else to call this; "nonononono" is silly out of context & annoying to remember
- promise: J+KL catchup → J returns pendant, "Don't make promises you can't keep." → J leaves, voiceover into J+WR
- stronger: alliance outing → challenge split, panic → WR complies, celebration
- jubilant: campfire talk, KL off → KL pendant/rabbit story → J+KL sendoff/J suggestion
- silence: KL not there → "...Em?"

# 09: But you
- (no title sequence?)
- ghost: KL+WR → J confronts, g'night → KL+Sq → "They're gone."
- suffocating: KL>Sq threat → J+WR trackdown, E's perspective
- leave-her: KL>Seq frustration, WR break-in → WR+Sq/J+KL, rabbits → u-turn/cave-in (→ cliffhanger?)

# 10: You can't save her
- intro/again: Sq+WR → J wakes up, trail
- following: J loses trail, finds alliance → filled in, rabbits → left, pulled back in → D says hello
- idly: WR out? → D+J motive interrogation--"From what? Herself?"
	- not sure on title; thoughtless, autopilot, something to the effect of "just acting on instinct, not seriously considering the ramifications." not quite *careless* ~~carless lol~~ though, it's more subconscious
- persist: D+J voiceover/fade, J spiraling up; "Terrance is my deadbeat brother" → A → A pathetic, "You can't give up now" → mistake.jpg → enter WR
- savior: "I'm here to save you," J refuses → chasedown tango "This place... these *people* change you." → WR nearly kiled, J leaves; rabbit-smash, "Do you think you're a fucking hero?"
- apex: KL's been waiting → goal reveal (confirmation?), heroism taunting → J doesn't, KL threatens → J assesses → hug
	- kinda eh on the title but "peak" doesn't Sound right, "climax" is too on-the-nose
- fall: pendant toss, sorry → J leaves

# 11: I miss you
- (no intro?)
- awake: J rises, observes room → down the hall → door ajar
	- "rises, observes room" is such dry-ass phrasing but I know what I'm referring to and That's What Matters(TM)
- release: there she is → as J works, KL wants out → bright, wake up → alone; "Thank you...! And... good bye."
- choice: Sq+WR, "Was this worth it?", "You think I'll make it?" → "DO'T GO"
- neighbor: <-- that scene
- anew: sendoff montage/letter, fade to black
