sum: |-
  Tall, wide, angular. Wears a military shirt, fingerless gloves, and stern expression. Often standoffish; can appear imposing. Easily rattled, however, and noticeably so; prone to stuttering and bouts of agitated, repetitive motions (which often involve the hands).
  
  Associated with **dull yellow**. (May appear, but shouldn't *actually* be, green---a rare instance of precise hex codes being important.)

    txt: "Hair bun is high by default, but falls over the day. <span class='ni'><span class='x'>Stylistic choice: </span>I try to keep it visible from any angle, even if it realistically wouldn't be, because it's recognizable.</span>"

    alt: Front and side views of Joceâ€™s face shape, with a simplified version noted above.
    txt: "**<span class='x'>Important: </span>Defined face shape**, more squarish than triangular. The nose is just as pronounced, with a noticeable indent at the top and bump at the tip. <span class='ni'><span class='x'>Stylistic decision: </span>At most angles, I push the jaw out for extra distinction.</span>"
  - id: eyes

    txt: |-
      Eyebrows are rough/uneven, and trail off at the end. <span class='ni'><span class='x'>Personal technique: </span>I basically just scribble horizontally, erase a bit in the same direction, then vertically erase & redraw a few stray lines at the outer end.</span>
      
      Eyes are deep-set; <span class='ni'>I don't always draw this but think it makes her look more tired.</span>
  - id: skin
    txt: "Skin is covered in scratch marks and acne scars, especially on the arms, hands, and face. **<span class='x'>Important: </span>Hands are *always* a mess**, which the gloves don't fully hide; <span class='ni'>the rest I usually don't draw, for visual clarity.</span> Placement and patterning of all these marks isn't consistent."

      - Shirt collar and "epaulets" are mildly disheveled.
      - Pant pockets are on the side.
      - <span class='ni'><span class='x'>Style choice: </span>Sharp, straight folds on the fabrics. Gloves are thicker.</span>
      - Shoes are partially covered.
