All of them; without Joce there is no story.

## author notes
- **Character inspiration** includes the following:
	- <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/were-you-talkin-to-me-537726745" class="ext">This drawing</a> was recycled for the design, but with curlier hair. The sweater was scrapped, then reused for the younger design.
	- <i>The Last of Us</i> (first game only) has been central to the protagonist's story from the getgo, with specific design cues taken from <a href="https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/Joel_Miller" class="ext">Joel</a> and <a href="https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/Marlene" class="ext">Marlene</a>.
	- I keep having punkish kid characters with rough backgrounds for some reason.
- **Song associations** are listed <a href="https://a-flyleaf.github.io/shriblets/2021-10-0304-tracklist/" class="ext">on the tracklist shriblet</a>. Also: "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk36ovCMsU8" class="ext">Silence</a>"
- The core of Joce's character (a bedraggled "jerk with a heart of gold" survivalist, if only in theory) hasn't changed much from early development. She *looked* a lot more unkempt in [early sketches]({%include url.html%}/gallery/roundups/2021-01), though.
- Also used to carry a switchblade. While it's still in-character, it seemed extraneous.
