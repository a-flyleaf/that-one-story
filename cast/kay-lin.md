<section markdown="1" id="desc" class="wrap">
Joce doesn't quite know what to make of Kay Lin; first she sees a sad little girl, but Kay Lin's a med student and rather friendly. She doesn't get much less confusing from there.

Still, Joce can't shake the image of someone who needs help, and Kay Lin seems content to stick around (albeit with prompting). Is this a mistake on both behalves? Probably. But what *else* are they supposed to do, pretend they never met? Ha, good luck with that.
