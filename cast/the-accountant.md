A tall, rather inscrutable individual if she does say so herself. Which she would. Because what *else* is there to be, another face in the crowd? Most people are *horrifically* transparent---but that's for another time.

What matters now is that there's a *challenge*, and this individual is going to *dissect* it. Too much trouble, really, doing anything else. It never amounts to much. But get to the core of a being---and *then* something's working.

Most people don't particularly trust the accountant, which is beyond her concern. Gary is an exception, bless his simple heart. He's a good lad.
