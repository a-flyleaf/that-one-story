## height/build
- Tallest of the main 8
- Apparently fairly thin, somewhat bony hands; uniform hides the rest
- Sharp angles; naturally-arched brow doesn't lend itself to soft expressions

## general demeanor
- Commands attention by appearance alone, but is perfectly content standing tall in the background observing the populace
- Cultivates an air of over-the-top scheming distance; excited genuity, however, is not difficult to discern
- Usually keeps hands crossed behind back, but can occasionally be caught making odd hand gestures with no discernible meaning

## other visual characteristics
- Looks down on most people, in more ways than one

Associated with <b>bright blue-green</b>. Aquamarine? Turquoise? Yes.
