			<p>Left, <strong>design notes</strong> for two of Kay Lin’s alternate appearances:</p>
		<ul><li>The first (pre-story) has earrings, frayed [shoulder-length] hair, a t-shirt that’s ripped on purpose, and is usually wearing some type of bracelet [and/or] rubberband.</li>
		<li>The second (late-story) has messy hair, a semi-loose tank top under an oversize dress shirt (semi-transparent, slips off [the shoulder] easily; cuffs are rolled up to fit), more even [bandage-]wraps, and is just straight-up barefoot.</li></ul>
			<p>Right, unrelated <strong>doodles</strong>:</p>
		<ul><li>From an ambiguous point of view, pre-story!Kay Lin pushes the viewer’s hands closed towards them. She’s smiling, blushing, tearing up a little; saying: “H-happy anniversary~❤”</li>
		<li>The other doodle is a scribbly late-story!Kay Lin on an intense blue-red gradient, holding a bottle.</li></ul></details>"

Has three alternate designs; two appear in-story, the third never shows up in canon, but exists anyway. <span class="spoiler">All but the last have definitively brown eyes.</span>

- The dubiously-canonical youngest version has shoulder-length hair and an outfit including a headband, pink cardigan, white turtleneck, and dark skirt. Associated with **faded pink**.
	- Outfit draws heavily from [Tsukiko Sagi](https://paranoiaagent.fandom.com/wiki/Tsukiko_Sagi).
- Pre-story verison, seen in <span class="spoiler">flashbacks only</span>, has chin-length hair and an outfit with stylistically-ripped trim and rubber bands on the wrists.
- Third and final version, <span class="spoiler">the transition to which starts in ep07</span>, has shorter, messier hair, bandages around the torso and wrists, and a loose button-down.

## episode appearances
All of them; the core of the story, next to Joce.

## author notes
- **Character inspiration** includes the following:
	- Although I didn't intentionally refer to <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/very-enthusiastic-about-honey-864456324" class="ext">this drawing</a> when designing Kay Lin (or the general setting for that matter), it defined a yellow-hued look anyway.
	- There's no shortage of quiet and/or mysterious girls with long black hair in media across the board; does it count as "inspiration" if I wasn't looking to any particular examples?
	- That said: there was one specific tweet (no longer online) comparing how a street orphan character was interpreted by a graphic novel vs animated adaptation; the latter looked more generically cutesy than the former. Kay Lin's default design takes a cue from the rags.
- **Song associations** are listed <a href="https://a-flyleaf.github.io/shriblets/2021-10-0304-tracklist/" class="ext">on the tracklist shriblet</a>. Also: "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN9yN8-_fVU" class="ext">Honeythief</a>"
- Kay Lin's climactic motivation (<span class="spoiler">get the protagonist to kill her</span>) hasn't changed from early development. The means of getting there, AKA <span class="spoiler">her relationship to Joce</span>, have changed a *lot*.
