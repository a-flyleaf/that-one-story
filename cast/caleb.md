Caleb's just a little thing. He seems very lost, and very upset about it, and maybe he's just upset about everything in general, b-but he's trying his best...! And he *really* admires Addison, who was nice enough to give him a second look, ehehe. Not a lot of people do that....

O-of course, there's more to him than being a wuss! He *hates* it when people are mean. Jerks have no place in Caleb's bubble, or near anyone he cares about. He's not here for *no* reason---but he won't share it with just anyone! (It'd be nice if someone stuck around long enough to find out....)
