sum: |-
  Very tall, very particular, and typically unimpressed---but rather enthused when fixated. Bright-suited with irises to match; white hair is dyed that way. Prone to odd hand movements.
  
  Associated with **aqua**, blue-green, green-blue, whatever you call it; always saturated, but can stand out less in certain lighting.
