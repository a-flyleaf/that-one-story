sum: |-
  Very tall, very particular, and typically unimpressed---but rather enthused when fixated. Bright-suited with irises to match; white hair is dyed that way. Prone to odd hand movements.
  
  Associated with **aqua**, blue-green, green-blue, whatever you call it; always saturated, but can stand out less in certain lighting.

      - Eyebrows are the color giveaway. Naturally arched; along with thin eyes, <span class='ni'>default expression<span class='x'>(as I draw it) </span> can appear sardonic and/or faintly amused.</span>
      
      - Lines around the inner eye are a slight indent/wrinkle, *not* eyebags.
      
      - Nose tapers to a point and slants downwards; profile is otherwise fairly flat.
      
      - Very slight cheekbone definition.
      
      - Long face, pointed chin.

      - Suit lapels are peaked.
      
      - Not visible in reference, but **<span class='x'>(important:) </span>wears gloves** over bony hands. Prone to **odd hand gestures** when talking; otherwise keeps them **folded behind back** by default.

there's no page.content bit in the layout so this can be whatever. note-images drawn at the usual size with the usual brush, then cropped
