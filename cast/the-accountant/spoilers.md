## author notes
- **Character inspiration** is pretty much two older concepts in a ~~trenchcoat~~ pantsuit:
	- Is the Anime Villain™ that <a href="https://a-flyleaf.github.io/hello-world/about/valerie" class="ext">another character of mine</a> didn't quite stick to being.
	- Inadvertently recyled the design and "pompous rich asshole" vibe of an unused minor character, the Parfum Palace master, in <a href="https://a-flyleaf.github.io/projects/tfe/" class="ext">an old project</a>.
- **Song association** is the track "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRfWy8R9zPk" class="ext">Terry Time Too</a>"
- Characterization has swung back and forth over time; sometimes too serious, sometimes too silly. Has always been paired with Gary, initially as part of a "perfect couple"; they remain largely amicable, but there's never been a trace of romantic affection on her part.
