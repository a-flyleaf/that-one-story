## author notes
- **Character inspiration** is kinda just <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoner" class="ext">The Stoner archetype</a>. Has surface parallels to <a href="https://a-flyleaf.github.io/toyshelf/disaster-crew/nico" class="ext">a similarly-dreary older character of mine</a> but it wasn't intentional.
- Lacks a song association, to memory. Maybe something trippy like "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IsSpAOD6K8" class="ext">Once in a Lifetime</a>"?
- Effectively unchanged from the earliest drafts, but lives longer now.
