  Lanky to the point of boniness, hunch-necked, and looks like they just rolled out of bed. Slouches for days [albeit not shown in reference for height clarity]. Striped sleeves and faded hair tips used to be brighter. Pajama pants and slippers all the way down.
  
  Associated with **indigo**; saturation heavily varies.

      - Slouches severely.
      - Longish neck with noticeable Adam's apple; always bent forward to some degree, even when standing upright.
      - Defined, gaunt collarbone.
      - Gangly limbs.
      - Somewhat big hands; frequently dangling at sides, held limp around torso, or absently picking teeth.

      - Rounder face with a tapering chin.
      - Has serious eyebags and stubble. Messy eyebrows, <span class='ni'>which match how I draw the rest of the eye. They *have* an eye color but, because of this stylization, it's not discernible.</span>
      - Big, wide nose; flat at the top, slopes down.
      - Teeth are crooked.

      Top is one piece, not a T-shirt over a long sleeve or armwarmers. <span class='ni'><span class='x'>Some trivia: It's</span>Riffed loosely from the â€™90s--2000s-inspired look of 100 gecs, specifically from the [<i>1000 Gecs</i> album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000_Gecs).</span> Sleeve stripes are thin; count doesn't matter.
      
      Clothes in general are **<span class='x'>(importantly) </span>very worn**; shirt neck is is wide for lack of elasticity, logo is faded. Pajama-sweatpants are frumpy. Small wonder the slippers stay on.

      Shirt logo is based on the "devil horns" or "rock on" hand sign (ðŸ¤˜), a gas mask, and (more loosely, by sheer coincidence*) a rabbit. (Also see [initial brainstorming](../../../gallery/roundups/2021-06) and [solo art](../../../gallery/teef); both designs are outdated but get the idea across.)
      
      <span class='ni'>\*(Fun fact: This logo design came before the rabbits! The idea that would *become* the rabbits had been around for much longer, but they didn't take shape for another few months.)</span>

there's no page.content bit in the layout so this can be whatever. note-images drawn at the usual size with the usual brush, then cropped
