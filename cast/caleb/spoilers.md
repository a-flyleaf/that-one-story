Doesn't have any alternate designs, unless <span class="spoiler">wearing a pendant-necklace</span> counts.

## episode appearances
- **[01]({%include url.html%}/story/01)**--**[02]({%include url.html%}/story/02)**: Clings to and mostly cowers behind Addison from after the first challenge onward. Later, <span class="spoiler">follows her underground and urges her to use the pendant before they leave.</span> <span class="spoiler">It's unclear whether he realizes he's leaving her behind or not.</span>
- **[03]({%include url.html%}/story/03)**: <span class="spoiler">Attempts to target Joce during the challenge, but gets targeted (and eliminated) himself; continues trying to badmouth Joce post-challenge anyway. Later shows up at Gary's house party, claiming he got kicked out by the alliance. Makes small talk with (and lowkey antagonizes) Joce and Kay Lin. </span><span class="spoiler">Witnesses Joce hitting Kay Lin, follows them out, and chases Joce down to demand an apology. When she refuses, he attacks. </span><span class="spoiler">Before the hit can land, Kay Lin kills him.</span>
- <span class="spoiler">His body melts away after this.</span>

## author notes
- **Character inspiration** is, essentially, an idea I'd been wanting to play with for years (<a href="https://a-flyleaf.github.io/toyshelf/disaster-crew/ava" class="ext">previous</a> <a href="https://a-flyleaf.github.io/toyshelf/disaster-crew/levi" class="ext">attempts</a> didn't stick): an incredibly anxious person who <span class="spoiler">uses their anxiety to intentionally invoke pity and justify, if only to themselves, righteous behavior</span>. I associated these traits heavily with "soft pastel uwu" aesthetics, and here we are.
	- He also takes minor design cues from <i>South Park</i>'s <a href="https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Tweek_Tweak" class="ext">Tweek Tweak</a> and <a href="https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Butters_Stotch" class="ext">Butters Stotch</a>---moreso the softer versions that appear in fanart than anything in the actual show.
- **Song associations** are "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGpydKymkIo" class="ext">Cry Baby</a>" and, to a lesser extent (maybe more [a song he'd *listen* to]({%include url.html%}/gallery/roundups/2021-08) than one I'd say *characterizes* him), "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxvP7PlM86I" class="ext">Greek God</a>"
- Effectively unchanged from early drafts. If anything, his shithead tendencies have been emphasized more over time, but maybe that's just because I find "smug asshole" more fun to draw than "anxious bby."
