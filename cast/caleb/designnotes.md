sum: |-
  Timid little guy who's usually sinking into his sweater, pitching a fit, or both. Huge, nervous eyes and a mouth that's always wavering. Clothes drown him in soft pastels; hands are almost always tucked into long sleeves.
  
  Associated with **pink**, usually pale.

      I genuinely do not know what his hair is doing. Is it curly? straight? The world may never know. <span class='ni'>The way I draw it, the "bumps" tend to tilt outward from a straighter "nub" at the back of the head.</span>
  - id: face
    txt: |-
      Round face, round nose.
      
      **<span class='x'>Important: </span>Eyes are big, wide, and perpetually sad- and/or nervous-looking**; <span class='ni'>I tend to tilt the outer line downwards for a droopy look.</span> Short, round eyebrows.
      
      **<span class='x'>Also important: </span>Mouth is usually quivering or otherwise tense**<span class='ni'>; I almost always draw it with shaky lines, even with open-mouthed or smiling expressions.</span>
  - id: clothes
    txt: |-
      - Sweater is big on purpose; **<span class='x'>(important:) </span>hands are rarely if ever visible**.
      - The leggings *could* have cutout designs<span class='ni'> but I am too lazy to draw them consistently so they don't.</span>
      - Boot fuzz could also be swapped out for loose socks or something. Just put something pink and soft there.

there's no page.content bit in the layout so this can be whatever. note-images drawn at the usual size with the usual brush, then cropped

**<span class='x'>Important: </span>Significant thing.**
