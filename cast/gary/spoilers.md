## author notes
- **Character inspiration** is, more or less, a generic jock. No particular visual or characterization sources.
- Song association used to be "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q1p89oUQUM" class="ext">Big Fun</a>;" it got less fitting as his character changed.
- Did a developmental u-turn, from A Douchebagâ„¢ to one of the friendliest characters among the main eight. Has always been paired with the accountant, initially as part of a "perfect couple"; they remain one of the more amicable duos, but nothing remotely romantic has remained.
