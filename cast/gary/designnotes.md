sum: |-
  Big, round, and pretty chill. Besides heterochromia, his palette doesn't stick out; his gregarious attitude is less subtle. Soft varsity jacket is sometimes buttoned up, sometimes open, whatever he feels like.
  
  Associated with **reddish-brown**.

      Made of round rectangles and **friendly<span class='x'> (that adjective is key)</span>** circles. **<span class='x'>Important: </span>Not thin; more fat than muscle**, with a wide neck and double chin.

      Gary keeps it simple <span class='ni'>and, as a stylistic touch, his eyes are basically just dots from any distance. When he looks around, the whole dots move; eyebrows help a lot to indicate direction.</span>
      
      He could have freckles. <span class='ni'>He doesn't, when I color him, because it would look weird with the (purely stylistic) lack of sclera.</span>

      - Jacket shoulders are cut at sharp, wide angles; offset by softer fabric & Gary's body shape.
      - Open jacket = more comfortable.

      Jeans are tucked into sneakers, which have velcro straps.
