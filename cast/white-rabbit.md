## height/build
- Fourth-tallest of the main 8
- Built like a tank with obvious muscle on top
- Wide angles, sharp color-value contrasts

## general demeanor
- Not afraid to put strength on display, but not without apparent reason
- Once obtained, often keeps baseball bat slung over shoulder
- Difficult to read; apparently mute, “skull” is static, and rarely gestures, but “ears” can betray reactions

## other visual characteristics
- Limbs are being gnawed at by... something
- Never seen without bandana
- Eyes are not quite in the right place for a human; cause debatable

Associated with <b>pale yellow and/or blue</b>; always more off-white than saturated.
