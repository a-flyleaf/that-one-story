sum: |-
  Painfully average in most regards, but trying very hard to project otherwise. Later swaps some passive whites in her outit with darker leather, which she thinks makes her look pretty cool, and picks up a pendant necklace while she's at it.
  
  Associated with **orange**, typically brighter.

notes:
  - id: hair
    img: url
    txt: Has a square hair clip in the back, takes it out later, the difference is negligible.
  - id: face
    txt: Face has a very slight curve out at the cheeks; chin tapers in a point. Small nose, but not as flat as <a href='../kay-lin/designnotes'>Kay Lin</a>'s.
  - id: clothes
    txt: "<span class='ni'><span class='x'>Some trivia: </span>Jacket is loosely ripped off from an image search result of Katnis from <i>The Hunger Games</i> film. (Disclaimer: I only know about this series from pop culture osmosis (and people complaining about the movie). Seems like something Addison would be into, though, flawed film and all.)</span>"
