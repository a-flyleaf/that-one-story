sum: |-
  Probably a human being---ignoring the rabbitesque skull-head and white-rot gnawing at the limbs. Muscular, and capable of typical human movement (facial expressions notwithstanding). Outfit might've been some kind of outdoorsy getup, but it's missing something; a black bandana obscures the lower head. Seems self-assured, but doesn't talk.
  
  Associated with **pale yellow**.

      **<span class='x'>Important: </span>Thick build, defined muscles.** Limbs and neck have typical range of movement, though whitish areas would feel severely calloused and slightly cold to the touch.

      - Upper curve of the head is convex from the side, but may appear concave from other angles due to snout protrusion. <span class='ni'><s>(also, I am not as consistent with it as with other characters' features yet.)</s></span> See [3d turnaround](../../../gallery/spin) for a low-poly reference.
      - "Ears" are capable of moving for expressiveness, but rarely do.
      - **<span class='x'>Important: </span>Area inside "skull" is void, with no discernible form.** <span class='ni'>Eyes are usually stylized to suggest shadow.</span>
      - The rest of the head **<span class='x'>(important:) </span>does not deform**; no furrowed brows or mouth movements.
      - Front teeth are thin, long, and relatively flat along the muzzle curve; "back" teeth are blunter like human molars. **The two at the very front are longest.**
      - Bandana suggests a jawline but **<span class='x'>(important:) </span>never comes off**. Back of the head is rarely if ever shown.

      <span class='ni'>Clothes can be a little frayed at the edges. Or not. I don't draw this consistently.</span>

there's no page.content bit in the layout so this can be whatever. note-images drawn at the usual size with the usual brush, then cropped
