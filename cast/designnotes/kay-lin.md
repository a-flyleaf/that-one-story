  Small, thin, young-looking. Clothes are ragged, with a shirt that's a couple sizes too big; neck, hands, and feet are exposed save for uneven bandage-wraps. Irises can appear bright yellow-gold. Demeanor shifts by the scene.
  
  Associated with **purple**, which is dull by default.

      <span class='ni'><span class='x'>Entirely a style thing: </span>For some reason I keep drawing her bangs with this exact configuration of lines.</span>
      
      <span class='ni'>If she's facing the viewer's right, the "tip" disappears, and some hair gets pushed out on the other side for a nicer silhouette.</span>
  - id: face
    txt: |-
      <span class='ni'><span class='x'>Another style quirk: </span>Nose is basically just a line, lower edge optional. Eye proportions aren't consistent, but generally not as long as the nose line.</span> Flat profile.
      
      <span class='ni'>Eyebrows and pupils are optional, depending on the expression.</span> **<span class='x'>Important: </span>Irises appear bright gold-yellow.** Whether this is diegetic doesn't matter.
      
      Face is thin and round. Chin should *not* taper in a point.

    alt: Neck wrap noted below is only on one side.
    txt: "Exact configuration of bandage-wraps doesn't need to be consistent*, but they trail off from the hands & feet. *<span class='x'>Important </span>Exception: **One strip goes up the left (viewer's right) side of the neck.**"

      **<span class='x'>Important: </span>T-shirt is way too big**; most noticeable around the neckline (looser than it should be), sleeves (attached well below the arm & extended a little past the elbow), and bottom edge (terminates around the upper thigh).
      
      "Skirt" is basically just a wrap of undecorated fabric.

there's no page.content bit in the layout so this can be whatever. note-images drawn at the usual size with the usual brush, then cropped

**<span class='x'>Important: </span>Significant thing.**

<span class='ni'><span class='x'>Less important: </span>Stylistic thing.</span>
