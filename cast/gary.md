## height/build
- About mid-height among the main 8, top of the lower half
- More visible fat than muscle, but not afraid to throw his weight around
- Squarish with the corners rounded off

## general demeanor
- Tries not to look imposing, but can't help but accentuate speech with big gregarious gestures
- Defaults to being touchy-feely but takes note when this is unwelcome
- Just here for to have a good time and get along; not a fan of "drama"

## other visual characteristics
- Stylized without sclera, which makes freckles look weird, but he *would* have light face freckles
- Casual, comfortable clothes; already stands out a bit from heterochromia, doesn't emphasize it

Associated with <b>deep red</b>, more mahogany than brown.
