- Name: Gary!
- Favorite color: Red!
- Likes: Hockey, chilling with his bros, making friends and having a good time. (Suits is pretty cool, too.)
- Dislikes: "Drama," buzzkills, being rude for no reason. (Who *does* that?)
- Fun fact: Good with kids! Even big kids. Why grow up, anyway? That's too much, dude.
