"other/misc" cast page: sal & hellrabbits might warrant new pages; otherwise neighbors, wolf-skull, nameless, medic

stick to physical descriptions, demeanor shifts? doing an all-out bio would get unwieldly with some people (namely J+KL)
alternatively do it like a TL;DR wiki? or maybe like, instead of the usual bio, just summarize what they Do in each episode. that should do it, and covers as much of their backstory as is relevant (without getting too diegetic about everything)

this is definitely not suppoed to be public but what the hell.
