## height/build
- Third-shortest of the main 8 (by a wide margin; Kay Lin and Caleb are noticeably shorter)
- Average in pretty much every way

## general demeanor
- Projects confidence, prone to acting like she owns the place (regardless of actual familiarity)
- Gesticulates frequently when talking, especially to point at subject(s) in focus
- Minimal filter; very, very bad at faking otherwise

## other visual characteristics
- Really, there's nothing; certainly doesn't mind standing out a *little,* but doesn't want to be the most glaring person in the room either

Associated with <b>orange</b>, usually bright.
