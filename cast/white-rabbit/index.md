		<details class='imgdesc wrap castdesc'><summary>written description</summary>Medium-tall-ish, mostly dark-skinned (sans whitish fade at the limbs), heavy build. By default, wears a pale yellow T-shirt, cargo shorts, and tan shoes; clothes are frayed at the edges. Standout trait: Where a human head would be is an exaggerated rabbit skull with long teeth, big eye sockets, and two “ears” extending from the back of the head. A black bandana covers the “jawline” and part of the neck.</details>

## height/build
- Fourth-tallest of the main 8
- Built like a tank with obvious muscle on top
- Wide angles, sharp color-value contrasts

## general demeanor
- Not afraid to put strength on display, if situation calls for it; not, however, showy without cause
- Upon obtaining it, often keeps baseball bat slung over shoulder
- Difficult to read; apparently mute, rarely gestures, and “skull” does not emote, but “ears” can betray reactions

## other visual characteristics
- Limbs are being gnawed at (engulfed?) by... something
- Never seen without bandana
- Eyes are not quite in the right place for a human; cause is debatable

Associated with <b>pale yellow and/or blue</b>; always more off-white than saturated.
