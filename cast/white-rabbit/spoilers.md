## author notes
- Character inspirations lost to memory, if any? Mostly shaped as the story developed, rather than having a distinct identity from the getgo.
- **Song associations** are <span class="spoiler">"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSYM3Z9B8Us" class="ext">2 Heads</a>" (pre-story) and "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVph5zlM5JA" class="ext">Stay In your Coma</a>"</span>
- Is effectively two underdeveloped characters smushed into one: #8, the obligatory final half of the last pair (and, bluntly, <span class="spoiler">death fodder</span>), and <span class="spoiler">Kay Lin's lost love</span>.
- I did not know for the longest time whether the <span class="spoiler">rabbit head</span> was a <span class="spoiler">transformation (unremovable)</span> or a <span class="spoiler">mask (removable, at least hypothetically)</span> or even a <span class="spoiler">non-diegetic visual motif</span>. I still don't have a Definitive Answer™, but it's absolutely not <span class="spoiler">purely artistic</span>.
