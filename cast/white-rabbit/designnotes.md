sum: |-
  Probably a human being---ignoring the rabbitesque skull-head and white-rot gnawing at the limbs. Outfit might've been some kind of outdoorsy getup, but it's missing something; a black bandana obscures the lower head. Seems self-assured, but doesn't talk.
  
  Associated with **pale yellow**.
