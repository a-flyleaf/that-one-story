## height/build
- Shortest of the main 8
- Pudgy, weak as hell; doomed to be baby-faced forever
- Big circles all-around

## general demeanor
- Near-perpetual expression of stress and/or fear
- By default, keeps hands curled in and buried by sleeves; clings physically to anyone he deems trustworthy
- Prone to outbursts and immediately shrinking back; keenly aware he's written off as immature

## other visual characteristics
- Dresses like he's not sure if he wants to draw attention to himself or sink into his sweaters
	- \[Used to have stars on the leggings but I can't be bothered to draw that consistently]
- Light, soft pastels for days

Associated with <b>pink</b>, skews more pale than saturated.
