The writer of a letter Joce receives in ep01. Associated with **white** and **murky greens**.

## visual characteristics
- Taller than Joce when they meet, but shorter than her when she's fully-grown
- Languid and thin, without a trace of muscle
- Always seen with a hair part covering the (viewer's) right eye and an over-the-shoulder ponytail
- Wears exclusively black and white; frequently dons dark eyeshadow and black nails
	- \[artist's piddling sense of fashion does not do this (hypothetically) sultry gothic wardrobe justice]
- Does not look different whatsoever through the years; changes are only surface
- Often seen smoking, indoors and out

## episode appearances
- **[01]({%include url.html%}/story/01)**: Not clearly seen. As a youth, Joce saves a pale figure who calls her a "hero" and draws her in, but who ultimately leaves. In the present, Joce receives a letter from "S." It's immediately shoved in a drawer full of letters from the same sender.
- **[03]({%include url.html%}/story/03)**+**[05]({%include url.html%}/story/05)**: Not quite seen; Joce is haunted by a pale figure in abstracted, hazy sequences. The letter is read in ep05, revealing a furious tirade that nonetheless demands the recipient's favor.
- **[06]({%include url.html%}/story/06)**--**[07]({%include url.html%}/story/07)**: Spurred by the letter's reading, flashback sequences show the circumstances of Joce and "S"' meeting, relationship, and eventual leave.
- **[10]({%include url.html%}/story/10)**: Not seen; in a closing sequence, Joce writes back, then lets the letter go. It dissolves into nothing.

## author notes
- This person's name in my notes is <i>Salvador "Skoal" Flores</i>. I don't think there's a canonical instance where the name actually gets *used*, though.
	- "Salvador": from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD" class="ext">Dalí</a>
	- "Skoal": from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toast_(honor)#Toasts_worldwide">the Nordic toast</a>
	- "Flores": from the song "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAucVNRx_mU" class="ext">Jocelyn Flores</a>"
- Design takes cues from <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Piers" class="ext">Piers from <i>Pokémon</i></a> and <a href="https://looneytunes.fandom.com/wiki/Pep%C3%A9_Le_Pew" class="ext">Pepé Le Pew</a>, and probably other black-and-white characters I'm forgetting about.
- Song association: "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8zyJFHMdDg" class="ext">I'm an independent man</a>"
- Didn't exist in the very earliest versions of the story. I forgot where the idea came from but it immediately became central.
