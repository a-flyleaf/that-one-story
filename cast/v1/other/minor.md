None of these people have names. Ordered chronologically by first appearance.

## "the neighbors"
The couple who implicitly owns the house where Joce lives; she finds them irritating but harmless, and the same seems to apply vice versa.
- **[ep01]({%include url.html%}/story/01)**: Joce finds them cleaning her room. She doesn't appreciate it. One gives her her mail on the way out.
- **[ep11]({%include url.html%}/story/11)**: Joce has an arrangement with one to screen her mail. They're on much better terms.

## "the fallen"
The first person to die; barely seen. They're wearing a necklace; as a minor detail, Joce recognizes the same accessory strangling the rabbit that attacks her in ep01.

## "wolf-skull"
A person wearing a canid skull who joins Addison's alliance early. A bit of a loose canon.
- **[ep02]({%include url.html%}/story/02)**: Questions Addison's leadership capabilities. Is part of her recruitment party (alongside White Rabbit, Caleb, and a third), and later blames Addison for letting the third fall to the rabbits.
- **[ep03]({%include url.html%}/story/03)**: Eager to attack whoever's in the hotseat during the challenge. Tells the rest there's no hard feelings post-game; Joce doesn't buy it.
- Dies unceremoniously offscreen at some point between then and ep07.

## "nameless"
A person with a loose resemblance (but no relation) to Kay Lin.
- **[ep03]({%include url.html%}/story/03)**: Offers a decent defense during the challenge, but falters when questioned and (correctly) sussed out.
- **[ep04]({%include url.html%}/story/04)**: Accidentally jumpscares an overtired Joce.
- Might make other sporadic background cameos.

## "the medic"
A healer Joce befriends.
- **[ep04]({%include url.html%}/story/04)**: Minor cameo as one of several people Joce attempts (in vain) to talk to. From the background, might tell people to back off when tensions mount. (It doesn't work.)
- **[ep07]({%include url.html%}/story/07)**--**[08]({%include url.html%}/story/08)**: Now part of the alliance, in charge of taking care of Kay Lin; Joce befriends them through frequent visits.
- **[ep09]({%include url.html%}/story/09)**: Part of the party who finds and tries to "rescue" Joce. Tries to convince her to leave with them. (This doesn't work either.)
- Maaaaaybe tiny cameo in the last episode? We'll see.
