## height/build
- Second-tallest of the main 8, but slouches severely
- Scrawny, lanky, bony, especially at the joints
- Loosely-scrawled features on hunched, lazy posture

## general demeanor
- Floats through the days without a care in the world; slow: physically, verbally, and arguably mentally
- Hard-pressed to show any extreme emotion; unclear whether for lack of need or willingness
- If not standing blankly staring into space, absently picks teeth and/or chews fingers

## other visual characteristics
- Not at all clean-shaven, but keeps facial hair stubbly
- Sometimes actually bothers to get dressed all the way, but not today

Associated with <b>indigo</b>; saturation varies from technicolor to cool gray.
