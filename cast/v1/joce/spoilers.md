			<p>Left, <strong>brainstorming</strong>: blocky colors of potential outfit changes.</p>
		<ol><li>Joce's default</li>
		<li>Potential scene snippet: Joce in a doorway; white shirt</li>
		<li>Shirt changed to ochre, dark pants, shoes recolored to match. side note: “good color but needs More?”</li>
		<li>More color explorations; tried a jacket but “Eh,” comparing with White Rabbit), and a third variation was “not bad but kinda young[-looking]? adolescent-y”</li>
		<li>Tried a grayer version but “eh, too Seq[uitur]-y?”</li>
		<li>Finally, just opened the shirt-jacket more on the original concept (over a black undershirt). “<strong style='text-transform:uppercase;font-weight:normal;'>Hm.</strong>”</li></ol>
			<p>Right, outfit details from the <strong>design notes</strong>:</p>
		<ul><li>[hair bun] stays down by default</li>
		<li>[clothes are] rounder, looser</li>
		<li>undershirt around collarbone</li>
		<li>same gloves [as default]</li></ul></details>"

Has [four alternate designs]({%include url.html%}/gallery/changes). <span class="spoiler">All but the last are seen in flashbacks only.</span> The first two typically have visible scratches on the face and arms, and optionally other temporary injuries (black eye, nose bandaid).

- Youngest version has short hair, a sweater, and often wields a baseball bat. Associated with warm hues, primarily **dull reds and browns**.
- Second version has longer hair (worn down) and a cool monochrome outfit including a beanie, vest, and armbands. Associated with **desaturated blue**.
- Third version also has longer hair, and wears a jacket with a fur-lined hood. Associated with **murky green**.
- Fourth version, seen in <span class="spoiler">ep08 onward</span>, has a lower bun and warmer-toned outfit than default. Color association shifts gradually to <span class="spoiler">**golden brown**.</span>

## episode appearances
All of them; without Joce there is no story.

## author notes
- **Character inspiration** includes the following:
	- <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/were-you-talkin-to-me-537726745" class="ext">This drawing</a> was recycled for the design, but with curlier hair. The sweater was scrapped, then reused for the younger design.
	- <i>The Last of Us</i> (first game only) has been central to the protagonist's story from the getgo, with specific design cues taken from <a href="https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/Joel_Miller" class="ext">Joel</a> and <a href="https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/Marlene" class="ext">Marlene</a>.
	- I keep having punkish kid characters with rough backgrounds for some reason.
- **Song associations** are listed <a href="https://a-flyleaf.github.io/shriblets/2021-10-0304-tracklist/" class="ext">on the tracklist shriblet</a>. Also: "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk36ovCMsU8" class="ext">Silence</a>"
- The core of Joce's character (a bedraggled "jerk with a heart of gold" survivalist, if only in theory) hasn't changed much from early development. She *looked* a lot more unkempt in [early sketches]({%include url.html%}/gallery/roundups/2021-01), though.
- Also used to carry a switchblade. While it's still in-character, it seemed extraneous.
