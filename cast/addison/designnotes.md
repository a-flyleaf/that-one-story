sum: |-
  Painfully average in most regards, but trying very hard to project otherwise. Later swaps some passive whites in her outit with darker leather, which she thinks makes her look pretty cool, and picks up a pendant necklace while she's at it.
  
  Associated with **orange**, typically brighter.
