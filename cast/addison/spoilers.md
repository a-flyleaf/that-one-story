Has two(ish?) alternate designs.

- The first, seen from the end of ep01 onward, makes some outfit readjustments: the shrug is swapped for a jacket, sneakers for boots, and now she's got a belt and pendant necklace.
- The second, seen in <span class="spoiler">ep10</span>, consists of <span class="spoiler">the "limbo" state and the transformation into a "hellrabbit."</span> <span class="spoiler">Once turned, Addison-as-human is wholly unrecognizable.</span>
	- \[these could really be two different designs but I haven't figured out the earlier state yet oops]

## episode appearances
- **[01]({%include url.html%}/story/01)**: Grandstands. Later gathers
 the alliance, and allows White Rabbit into the fold.
- **[02]({%include url.html%}/story/02)**: The central character of this episode. <span class="spoiler">Proposes a closer alliance with WR, but fails to recruit Joce; on the heels of that, witnesses a teammate's demise. Is unable to salvage her reputation with a speech and retreats underground, where Caleb intercepts. Finds out what the pendant can do, and </span><span class="spoiler">is left behind.</span>
- <span class="spoiler">**[ep10]({%include url.html%}/story/10)**: Has been wandering the underground in limbo. After a "pep talk" from Joce, transforms into a rabbit. WR intervenes, and ultimately destroys her.</span>

## author notes
- **Character inspiration** is, essentially, <a href="https://twitter.com/DystopianYA/status/796434475177672707" class="ext">this one tweet out of context</a> + <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gaslight-gatekeep-girlboss" class="ext">girlboss memes</a>. Addison is to the #GirlPower YA dystopia protagonist as Joce is to the "jerk with a heart of gold" gritty dudeguy video game protag; make of this what you will.
	- She also continues my inexplicable character trend of showy redheads.
- **Song association** is this one track <span class="spoiler">"<a href="https://tobyfox.bandcamp.com/track/dialtone" class="ext">Dialtone</a>" (and its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx2osSxkcGo" class="ext">alternate version</a>)</span>. (Niche footnote: I swear she was named before these released. Fun coincidence!)
- Hasn't changed a whole lot from early drafts, but <span class="spoiler">got a lot more [pathos]({%include url.html%}/gallery/roundups/2021-12) along the way</span>. Good for her!
