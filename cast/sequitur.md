Uhhhhhhhhhh, Sequitur. Right. Seq, uh... Sequitur's *here*, and like, that's pretty cool. Yeah, they look like they just rolled out of bed, but... life's too short, man. ’Sides, some of the stuff in this place is pretty weird. You see anyone else drinking this stuff? They're missin' out. Tastes real good. Like really good liquor. Ichor, even. Honey? Maybe something rancid. Who cares. Heh.

People tend to think Sequitur's kind of stupid, and Sequitur doesn't care enough to dispute it. Calm down, pick some teeth. S'all good, it'll work itself out in time.
