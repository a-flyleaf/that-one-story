No, that's not a nickname.

Uhhhhhhhhhh, Sequitur. Right. Seq, uh... Sequitur's *here*, and like, that's pretty cool. Yeah, they look like they just rolled out of bed, but... life's too short, man. ’Sides, this place is pretty weird, who cares ’bout "real" stuff. Hey, anyone else tried drinking this yet? They're missin' out if not. Tastes real good. Like real fine liquor. Ichor, even. Honey? Maybe something rancid. Heh, doesn't matter. Quiets the soul real good, it does.

People tend to think Sequitur's kind of stupid, and Sequitur doesn't care enough to dispute it. Calm down, pick some teeth. S'all good, it'll work itself out in time.
