## height/build
- Third-tallest of the main 8
- Bulky; fairly strong, but more fat than muscle
- Angular face, deep-set eyes

## general demeanor
- Attempts to carry herself with an air of quiet, confident stoicism, but can falter easily
- Can often be caught making some kind of repetitive motion for no externally-apparent reason, especially when agitated; lately it's been hand-focused
- Though generally defensive, rarely crosses arms; tends to turn away or even show her neck to danger instead

## other visual characteristics
- Severe acne scars, and various other scratches & scabs, basically everywhere
	- \[This is rarely drawn unless fresh or otherwise prominent, for visual clarity]
	- Hands, particularly fingers, are especially raw as of late; wears (fingerless) gloves to hide some of it
- Dresses for practicality, not for looks; wouldn't be caught dead in anything gaudy/revealing/eye-catching

Associated with <b>dull yellow</b>. While precise hex colors don't generally matter, this should *not* be an actual green hue.
