**In theory**: A quiet, confident stoic, whose standoffish demeanor is offset by a good heart and noble motives. Prepared for anything, and always willing to drop everything for those less fortunate.

**In practice**: Has been anticipating the apocalypse since yesterday. Prone to stuttering and repetitive hand motions. Rarely understands people (and convinced it's mutual). Still carries strong ideals, but without much to show for it.

**In conclusion**: Things were so much simpler back then, weren't they?
