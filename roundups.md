Starting in 2021, I've been ending each month with a giant wall of art that wouldn't otherwise have been posted. Originals are [on deviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/gallery/81345929/compilation-stuff); these versions have non-story-related content cropped and/or faded out.

<!--note to self: anything with J+KL takes thumbnail priority, but something finished/in full color would be nice. barring that, a somehow-representative sketch that DOESN'T include J/KL. no text ideal-->
