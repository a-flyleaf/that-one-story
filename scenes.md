a sentence a scene keeps the text wall awayeah it really doesn't but I can try

Part divisions are subject to change, especially around the middle, but for the sake of scope I would really like to not break 12. That said, lengths vary.

## 1
- tentative title: "Relapse"

Players wake in a panopticon-esque underground, and are welcomed to the game: many have entered, one will win, and the winner can go home.

Joce lives a mundane, predictable life in one room of a shared house, and has incessant intrusive thoughts of imminent disaster. (It's usually background noise.) But thanks to both a mild sprain that refuses to wear off and quarantine driving everyone battier than usual, especially Joce's housemates, the predictability feels stifling. In this context Joce receives two letters: one from "Salvador," which is shoved in a drawer full of unopened letters from the same sender, and an invitation to the thrill of a lifetime.

Back in the underground, one player has taken it upon herself to rally the others; Joce isn't interested. When the grandstander picks out someone much smaller, however, Joce takes notice. She approaches the nearest person with food, intimidates them, and offers the morsel to the girl in the corner.

Joce "stands guard," internally monologues/zones out about the world being harsh and the strong needing to look after the less fortunate, and then the girl asks what Joce is doing. Thus introduces Kay Lin, who is neither a child (claims she went to medical school, or was going to) nor withdrawn as Joce anticipated. Joce introduces herself by name without thinking and immediately regrets it.

The talk is interrupted by the underground flooding, which spurs the first challenge: escape, and the only way out is up—and crowding fast. Joce has a good grip until the first person falls, at which point she starts internally panicking. Kay Lin U-turns to reach out, after which they help each other up to the end.

Unfortunately Kay Lin's act incurred a penalty: while the other survivors gather supplies and weapons (baseball bats), Joce and Kay Lin get jack shit. Joce decides not to stick around; the "camera" lingers on a hand, rotted white, rising from the deep.

That central zone was below the Beacon, a huge structure resembling the red North arrow of a compass. Joce intends to trek to the boundaries of the landscape alone, but Kay Lin stays close. Their banter is interrupted by what sounds like someone screaming and/or crying, which Joce investigates despite Kay Lin's hesitance.

The wailing echoes out from a crevice; it's a rabbit, which attacks Joce on sight and swiftly overpowers her. Joce is faced with a "game over" screen, with two options: give up, continue. Though rattled, she doesn't want to abandon Kay Lin, and hits the latter option. It procures a small drink.

Joce wakes to find the rabbit has been dispatched and is half-melted through the ground; when she tries to lift the jaw for a closer look, it drips molten through her fingers. Upon seeing Kay Lin did this (blasting the rabbit with that ambiguous fluid, which is apparently *in* the rocks), Joce asks how she knew; Kay Lin admits she's too familiar with this place, but isn't sure why she's here.

As the sky darkens, Joce decides to keep Kay Lin around; that familiarity makes her simultaneously a valuable ally and a dangerous enemy. And on the basest level, Joce still feels the need to keep her safe—even though, if the game is whittling down the competition down to one, it can't last. Is she being played for a fool? If it means sticking to her guns, does she care?

### also of note
- There's a poster above Joce's bed of a gritty action hero, which she looks up at before the flashback cuts back to present. It is the one (1) sign of personality in an otherwise utilitarian room.
- Joce and Kay Lin's introduction is pronounced with a handshake. I basically have this whole conversation committed to memory—hence why, ironically, it's kinda skimmed over here.
- In the background of the challenge, there's an exchange like "Come on, Terry!" "Who?" "Gary!"
- The first person to fall is distinguished by some kind of necklace. The same accessory is strangling the rabbit.
- At a later point, Joce asks what Kay Lin is doing here. Kay Lin returns the question. Joce says it's not important. Same answer from Kay Lin, then. Oh yeah, mutual progress.
- Minor detail: after Joce wakes up from the "game over," she has a small ring of white-rot around the base of one finger. But since she wears gloves (and has all sorts of miscellaneous hand scratches), it's barely noticeable.
- Full disclaimer, I do not know how the little guys trigger the rock-blast-thing yet. But they do. They have their ways.

### post-credits? bonus? start of next installment??
Back at the Beacon base, the grandstander, Addison, has kept a sizable group around. (A timid boy she helped during the challenge, Caleb, stays especially close.) The figure that rotted hand belonged to, henceforth dubbed "White Rabbit" (WR; she *is* mostly human, though), approaches; WR doesn't talk, but indicates she wants to join the group. When Addison hesitates, WR takes a bat and smashes down a nearby structure, blasting a rabbit no one noticed was there.

No one's protesting after that.

- From the supply-gathering on, Addison has a slightly different outfit. It includes a necklace with an eight-pointed star pendant, which doesn't seem to be part of the usual handouts.

## 2
Over the first night, WR helped allies set up camp. Addison pulled her aside and, admitting to little faith in her own leadership or the alliance's longevity, proposed a "true" alliance.

The next day, Joce sets out on a straight path away from the Beacon, continuing her trek; she and Kay Lin troubleshoot a means of rabbit-blasting, but the journey is thankfully quiet.

Meanwhile, Addison struggles to keep up with everything going on with everyone, which is obviously something she must do; she gets fed up, rounds up three of the tough guys (WR included), and decides to scope out the land, grab more supplies. (Caleb insists on joining, too.)

Back at the Beacon, Addison's party finds Joce and Kay Lin puzzling over a map. Addison reintroduces herself, clearly interested in getting Joce on her side, but again Joce is unimpressed. Rabbits are spotted outside, which splits Addison and Joce from the group; Addison tries to propose similar to Joce as she did to WR, but Joce tells her off. Joce escapes with Kay Lin and one of Addison's "guards" is killed in the fray.

Returning to the alliance, the non-WR surviving guard, "Wolf," churns a rumor mill around Addison's incompetence, while only Caleb tries defending her. Addison tries an explanation/apology talk of dubious genuity, which mostly makes things worse.

That night Addison ventures underground, seemingly in hopes of finding something big or important that will make everyone love her again. (Probably following up on something she noticed back during the Beacon attack?) Caleb follows her down, and though they have a nice talk at first, Caleb insists on bringing her back. Frustrated, Addison sets something off (inadvertently? intentionally? intentionally, but worse than anticipated?); the space simultaneously floods and collapses. Caleb flees; Addison is left behind.

The Beacon summons players back with an ear-splitting alarm and a minor earthquake. Joce notices Caleb is alone; when the instructions begin, he cries louder, announcing that Addison is dead.

### also of note
- Addison concludes both her alliance offer to WR and her own reintroduction to Joce with a handshake; in the latter case, she prompts Joce's own name. The WR scene cuts after this, and Joce refuses the offer on both accounts.
- Joce is confused by the map because she walked away in a straight line and found the Beacon right back in front of her. This will be talked about explicitly later.
- Joce has thought Addison is full of shit from day one, but here she calls Addison on both talking as though Kay Lin isn't standing right there and, later, abandoning her crew to fight for themselves. This definitely gets under Addison's skin, though it remains unclear how much of her later upset is from Joce's words vs the reputational hit.
- When Addison gets frustrated with Caleb, she says something to the effect of "I am *not* leaving until I have everything under control."
- Maaaybe instead of randomly finding the pendant earlier, it's down here, and moving it is what sets things off? Idk. This part's still a lil fuzzy, but there *are* some kind of controls down here.
- Kay Lin takes a background role in this installment, but is among the majority who finds Caleb's outburst at the end more annoying than sympatheitc.

## 3
Thanks to Caleb it takes some fumbling for everyone to get the hang of what they're supposed to be doing, but for summary's sake: In the second challegne, players are divided into smaller groups of ~5, one of whom is a designated outlier. Going solely based on talk and one clue, non-outliers have to determine and vote out the oddity; the oddity simply has to be the last of two standing. The winner(s) advance to the next physical level for a prize at the peak; losers don't have to die this time.

Game one, round one: Joce and Kay Lin are grouped with Caleb, Wolf, and a fifth. Caleb accuses Joce of basically-murder for throwing Addison off yesterday; Kay Lin points out that's irrelevant to the challenge, turns the ever-aggressive Wolf on him, and thus Caleb is unanimously voted out. (Not the outlier.)  
Round two: Joce is called out for not saying much, tries to question Wolf, and regrets it immediately; Kay Lin interjects and swings the spotlight over to the fifth, who tries to defend but slips up. They're the outlier, game over.

Between challenge-games, Kay Lin asks Joce why Joce didn't scapegoat her. Joce can't answer before the next round begins.

Game two: Joce is grouped with the person who was teaming up with Gary during the challenge. (This person hasn't given a name yet, but for summary's sake I'll prematurely use what she *will* call herself: "the accountant.") They inadvertently team up, Joce following the accountant's lead, as they're both innocent and the accountant has a very sharp memory. Despite the easy victory, Joce is unsettled.

Game three: Joce is the outlier. She quickly determines she cannot lie for shit and folds.

Lingering at base, Caleb is still trying to convince people Joce is evil incarnate. Gary steps up to invite anyone who wants a break from the drama to join him at his place; only house rule is *no murder*. Unwilling to face the alliance's scrutiny, Joce joins them (and Kay Lin, as always, tags along).

At the house, Joce encourages Kay Lin to go socialize/see if anyone's on to them, while Joce investigates the place solo. Much of it is eerily empty, but at one point she gets overambitious, falls, and reaggravates the sprain. Kay Lin finds her, reports that no one cares, and tries to get close, spiking Joce's paranoia. The accountant interrupts to announce drinks are being served, with the unspoken implication attendance is mandatory.

### also of note
- Caleb is wearing Addison's necklace now.
- The fifth person in the first challenge-game, referred to in the cast as "[nameless]({%include url.html%}/cast#nameless)," looks vaguely similar to Kay Lin. Background people aren't generally visually defined, so the similarity could just come down to having long straight hair or something. They're not related. But it's intentional.
- There's probably some kind of character dynamic echo in the others from the second game, too. Haven't defined that yet.
- Yeah, I need to figure out the house layout and exactly what Joce gets tripped up by here.
- Did I mention this part hasn't been super fleshed-out yet?

## 4
At a table in the corner, Joce and Kay Lin are joined by Caleb, who offers a self-pitying apology to Joce and claims he was kicked out (or walked out, it's unclear) of the alliance now that Wolf's in charge. Caleb then tries to make small talk, which increasingly irritates Kay Lin; when he teases her directly, she has an outburst and spills her drink on Joce. Joce gets up and leaves.

The air reeks of other peoples' giddy stupors, and Joce starts drowning in a slurry of uncomfortable intimacy and overflowing bottles. Even outside is hazier than usual; Kay Lin finds Joce pacing, agitated. Joce tells Kay Lin to go away but Kay Lin keeps trying to reach out; when Kay Lin makes physical contact Joce jerks back on instinct, knocking her over. Joce notices Caleb watching from the window, panics, and flees the scene.

Joce tries to tell herself separation was inevitable and she's cutting her losses; she gets lost in the smog fast. Someone sets off blasts nearby, chasing her down. Caleb corners Joce and demands an apology, not for Kay Lin but for Addison, and then *maybe* he'll defend her when everyone else finds out; Joce refuses.

Caleb is about to stab her when *he* gets jabbed in the neck instead. Kay Lin stands behind him as his body falls, spasms, and melts through the cracks in the ground; she then gets uncomfortably close to Joce, gesturing to her own neck and saying how quickly a neck wound can kill. Joce can't move.

### also of note
- At the table as they sit down, Joce tells Kay Lin not to take a sip. Kay Lin agrees, as drinking "makes \[her] all red and fucked-up." It's implied she took a swig between getting shoved and when she appears again at the end of the installment.
- The outburst bit is like: Kay Lin makes a snarky comment → Joce, who's 
mostly trying to block Caleb out, tells KL to lay off → Caleb: "Yeah, 
why are you being so *mean* to me, Kayla? You should listen to your *girlfriend*~" KL: "She is NOT my—!"
	- It's a stock gag, I know. The intention is that Kay Lin is more infuriated, like Caleb just killed her dog, than embarrassed—though the latter sets in when Joce gets up anyway.
- When Caleb falls, his clothes dissolve with him. Minor detail: the pendant is not included, as Kay Lin breaks the necklace chain when she slices his neck. She glances down briefly before approaching Joce.
- Kay Lin is usually fairly expressive. For that last part, she's blank.

## 5
The first part of this installment flickers between the third challenge and brief snippets of the events between last installment and now. For ease of summarizing I'll just go chronologically:

After being frozen in that position for what felt like forever, the Beacon summons went off, and Kay Lin stepped back as if nothing had ever happened. There was no trace of Caleb. Kay Lin tried to talk a bit but Joce barely responded. They split on the way to the Beacon, though Joce constantly felt like she was being watched (a sense echoed during the challenge, although there, it's true).

The challenge splits players into two groups for a silent, uninterrupted capture-the-flag-type game—though instead of grabbing an item, the target is something to destroy. Players also tag each other via laser/jab to the neck.

Joce perceives much of this like a first-person shooter, although it seems less like she's having *fun* and more like this is a much-needed outlet to lose herself in. At one point she thinks she sees Kay Lin blocking her and nearly freezes, but it's "nameless" (the lookalike) and she pushes through. Towards the end, the actual Kay Lin is threatened but victory is in Joce's reach; she chooses victory, and the challenge ends as Gary shoves Kay Lin over.

The challenge prize is messages in bottles, letters from home; Joce neglects hers. As the adrenaline wears off, Gary congratulates her on a challenge well-won and invites her back to the house; she thinks it's a trap and resists, but Gary points out her exhaustion, and Joce relents. She crashes on the first bed she can find.

When Joce wakes up, her prize bottle is on the nightstand, along with a note from the accountant. Elsewhere in the house, Kay Lin is conversing casually with others, and noticeably bruised where Joce hit her last night; she doesn't maintain eye contact with Joce or vice versa.

Joce attempts to talk to people both to get a read on the situation and potentially make new allies, but it's a self-fulfilling spiral: she's not used to regular conversation, and the more tense she is the more erratic her behavior. Additionally, while Kay Lin hasn't accused her of anything, people have drawn their own conclusions.

When Joce sees Gary talking to Kay Lin and looking sympathetic, Joce panics. She tells Gary that she *is* responsible for the bruise but (for unrelated reasons) there's more to Kay Lin than meets the eye; however, Joce is unable to elaborate Gary asks if he can tell the accountant (no) and Joce notices people listening (oh *fuck* no).

Joce could use a drink, but goes to the next-best thing: the accountant's study. The accountant is puzzling over a map and is apparently impressed by Joce's input, which Joce appreciates. Gary steps in, apparently to ask the accountant about something; the accountant immediately recognizes this is about Kay Lin, which she takes as confirmation Kay Lin killed Caleb. The agreed punishment for breaking the house rule is simply getting kicked out, but the accountant excitedly thinks they need to revisit that; Gary apologizes for the trouble and asks Joce to wait outside.

Kay Lin is still halfheartedly entertaining chatter when Joce interrupts: they need to leave, *now*. The people Joce tried talking to earlier are wary if not antagonistic, and Kay Lin doesn't defend her; however, Gary pulls the duo aside. He admits he doesn't care what they did, but the accountant does, so he's going to send them off before this blows up. Before they go, Kay Lin asks for Joce's bottle; Joce insists she doesn't want it, but the accountant (who of course followed) hands it over. With that, Joce and Kay Lin get the hell out of dodge—albeit not particularly in sync.

### also of note
- Joce isn't a professional at the challenge or anything, but Gary's crew is mostly hungover.
- Three people left the house last night, two came back. Joce is first to bring this up when she rejects Gary's invitation, and there's no denial of the fact thereafter from anyone.
- Note attached to Joce's prize-bottle: "Someone's looking out for you ;) (P.S. Meet me in my study. You know where it is. —the accountant)"
- The accountant calls Joce a genius for recognizing that the world map is a loop; walking to one end just takes you back to the "opposite" side (hence Joce's confusion at the Beacon in part 2).
- Regarding murder-consequences, Joce says "Don't hurt her." The accountant makes no promises.

## 6
The two are not happy. Joce admits she sold Kay Lin out, but she tried to leave *before* Gary and the accountant could catch up because she cares, and that's a confession. Kay Lin, however, accuses Joce of having a savior complex, only dragging her (KL) along to feel better about herself. Joce asks what the hell Kay Lin was doing last night; Kay Lin eventually admits she was trying to provoke Joce, because she doesn't understand why Joce never fights back—or why Joce has stuck with her in general. Joce can sympathize with the final sentiment.

A rabbit or two interrupts the moment, but Joce and Kay Lin finally get to put their old technique into practice and it's awesome. They find shelter underground and all seems well, but Joce remains irked by the bottle and is reluctant to talk about it.

Come nightfall, Joce sneaks out to toss the whole thing to oblivion, but hesitates. Gary shows up, having been concerned all day (and, implicitly, frustrated with the accountant). Joce admits the letter is from... someone she does not like, and she thinks she knows what it says but can't bring herself to toss it without reading. Gary suggests she just read it, get it confirmed and over with.

Where Joce expects a sorry pity party begging for her back, she gets a scathing indictment from someone who feels abandoned, suicidal, and personally slighted. Sal blames her for their life having gotten worse since she left, declares intentions to die, thank you for nothing, go to hell.

Joce is incensed. Rabbits have closed in on her and Gary, and despite a semi-coordinated effort, Joce triggers a cave-in to kill the last one—and Gary is taken down in the process.

Kay Lin finds Joce standing despondently in the wreckage. She wades through the flood and wordlessly takes Joce's hand.

### also of note
- KL: "I don't understand why you never fight back. You could've, I dunno, shoved him back or thrown me off—" J: "Did you *want* to get stabbed?" KL: "Yes. *No!*"
- Towards the end of the argument, after the mutual understanding that neither Joce nor Kay Lin get why the other hasn't left for good yet, Kay Lin offers a reconciliatory handshake: "Here's to being fucked up." Joce's reply is that she would prefer not to be, but she accepts the motion.
- Standing over the melting rabbit(s), Joce wonders aloud if they're *all* people like the first to fall, or if the dead usually fade like Caleb. At the end, Gary is buried in a pool of rubble.

## 7
This episode and the next are interspersed with flashbacks, not necessarily in chronological order. I'm gonna skip that for now and [stick it between these sections](#78-flashbacks). TL;DR Sal was the ambigous clingy-rotty-melty person from Joce's alcoholic overwhelm, and their relationship was... A Lot.

&nbsp;

Between the re-exacerbated strain and general memory hell, Joce is stuck in a cycle of lethargy. Kay Lin is unable to get through to her, and eventually gets frustrated enough to leave for short periods. The interim periods, in which she returns mildly giddy and talking about someone she met, are framed in parallel to someone else coming home late.

Kay Lin meets Sequitur, the scraggly-looking fellow Joce "intimidated" way back in part 1 (though they don't recognize each other from this). Sequitur, who's been on their own this whole time and is happy to have company, takes Kay Lin to a cozy little alcove where they essentially get high on haze-fume. Kay Lin envies their perpetual nonchalance.

On the third visit, when Kay Lin is about midway down the claustrophobic route in, the path is blocked. The accountant is waiting for her on the other end, and blackmails her into following without protest: not only has the accountant produced the pendant, but the accountant threatens, essentially, to sic people on Joce.

Meanwhile, Joce is noticing that Kay Lin's been out for much, much longer than before. When she gets up to investigate, she's attacked by a mutated, zombie-esque Gary. He sounds almost lucid, which Joce eventually hears as a plea to kill him; reluctantly, she does the job, collapsing that entire segment of the underground.

### also of note
- The accountant's threat isn't really exaggerating or falsifying anything, more a way of phrasing. From an outsider's perspective: Joce and Kay Lin (who have already been weirdly isolated this whole time) went out one night when many people were under the influence, Joce later admitted to physically hurting Kay Lin (*and* Caleb happened to disappear around the same time), and despite the two being somewhat distant the rest of the day, Joce later made a fuss over getting Kay Lin to leave with her. Since then neither has been heard from, but the accountant has caught word that Kay Lin feels stifled. It is what the kids call Not A Good Look.
	- TL;DR it's not hard to frame Joce as a controlling asshole at *best*. Their appearances, and Joce's inabiliy to interact with others like a normal person, don't help.
- To seal the deal, the accountant offers a hand. Kay Lin ignores it; the accountant grabs hers anyway on the way out, with a very brief vicegrip. Any sign of protest from then on *will* be noticed.
- Gary's "zombie" design includes elongated limbs that bend where they shouldn't, greater overall size, and severe loss of fat & muscle. There are copious patches of white-rot and he probably no longer has eyes.

### post-credits? somewhere around the end of 7, start of 8? not sure where this fits in or if it's onscreen at all
The accountant takes Kay Lin back to the house, which is empty, and around to a back entry. At the first opportunity Kay Lin tries to run; the accountant OHKOs her with a bat. After checking for a pulse, the accountant is satisfied, drags her in, and locks the door.

## 7--8 flashbacks
(There's no reason for the tense switches here. They just Happened. That said, some of these bleed more into the present-day sequences than others.)

1. When Joce was young and tried to tell a not-quite-friend about the impending end of the world, she got frustrated and chucked a ball over the fence—smashing glass, setting off someone's car alarm. Sal was on standby, smoking and apparently not bothered; they were more interested in Joce's stuttering, mumbled apology, and her subsequent frustrations with her peers not *getting* it. Sal had a nihilistic outlook, too; Joce was both repulsed and intrigued. As an authority dragged her off, the car's owner (apparently Sal's date) returned, infuriated with Sal.
1. Through adolescence, Sal left Joce notes, and they met over private smoke breaks. She expressed ongoing frustration with authority, the system, the works; Sal commiserated, called her smart for seeing through it all, but encouraged her to finish high school. Then she'd look responsible, and when she turned 18 and the social workers were dying to offhand her, she could move in with Sal. Apparently their latest s/o had left them, just like they all did. Despite general abrasiveness and continuing to call them a weird-ass creep, Joce is sympathetic.
1. Days in Sal's shitty little abode bled into each other. It was them against the world, and if that meant rotting together, so be it. Many a night was spent jeering at whatever was on TV, varying degrees of drunk. While watching a soap in which the hero physically backstabs his love interest (Sal saw it coming from a season away, *ugh*), Sal suggests on a whim: "Let's get married. For tax benefits." Joce, already more drunk than they were, throws up.
	- It's unclear whether Sal ever went through with this. Joce is never seen with a ring, though in the next few segments she seems to have scratched that finger raw.
1. It's late. ("Unholy hour of the morning, maybe almost sunrise" late.) Joce stares blankly at the game over screen of a first-person shooter. When the door opens she comes to life; hey, that group is back in town— There are poorly-muffled makeout noises. Sal has brought someone home, and Joce is left standing blankly in the doorway.
	- "Don't mind her. She knows what she signed up for." "You *bastard~*"
1. All the ravishment in the world (between more *incidents,* of course, to keep things interesting) cannot snap Joce out of a dissociative trance. Sal gets tired of trying. Really, what did she expect?
1. One day Joce was actually leaving the house. Doctor's appointment. Sal almost speaks up, and Joce waits for anything. Instead they grumble about big pharma, and Joce slams the door behind her.  
It's daytime. Then it's not. Joce returns to a locked door. Key's useless. She backs away, trips on the steps—
1. —which parallel-cuts to her nearly slipping off the edge of a bridge. She catches herself; the rain is torrential. A flickering sign catches her attention: an advertisement for a movie in her favorite gritty action movie franchise. Now playing.

Pieces of the franchise also feature in snippets 1 and 2 through Joce's outfits, and 4 through her game; it's also the source of the poster in her room. I don't know what the series is called and its story is barely shown, but as a bonus detail: it's cliché as fuck, about an anti-hero tough guy with washes-hands-too-often-itis (what Hollywood calls OCD). In the specific movie of interest, antihero toughguy faces down against his Evil™ Temptress™ ex-wife. It is a sexist dumpster fire and Joce adores it.

## 8
- tentative title: "[Desperately safe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCywWxg5DoY)"

When Kay Lin blearily comes to (with a splitting headache, and tied to a support beam or something), the accountant takes her consciousness as confirmation: the only real prize for winning is boosted physical endurance. That said, the accountant has some questions.

Meanwhile, Joce finds Sequitur standing around the rubble of the alcove. Sequitur confirms having met Kay Lin here, and mentions that the accountant was asking about her and Joce. Before leaving, Joce apologizes for intimidating them earlier; Sequitur says they barely remember and do not care, which makes her feel weird.

As Joce reaches the house, Kay Lin is stalling. She doesn't deny having won the game before but offers nothing else about herself, and seemss unphased by threats of physical harm. (Joce follows the sound, and notices the accountant has set a trap resembling the way Joce fell earlier.)

The accountant, then, tries to demoralize Kay Lin by pointing out Joce hasn't showed up to help her; Kay Lin acts like this doesn't bother her. Perfect timing for the accountant to set off the trap, which was actually on the path Joce took to avoid the "obvious" (fake) one; Joce is incapacitated.

Kay Lin panics. She confirms explicitly that she's been the last person standing before, once, and that first game was with her girlfriend; the pendant was hers. At Joce's prompting, Kay Lin also admits Joce reminds her of said girlfriend, but denies having killed said gf or planning the same for Joce.

This is a letdown to the accountant, who was hoping there was a more  exciting reason someone like Kay Lin had made it so far. At this point  Kay Lin is choked up; when the accountant leaves Joce to hear Kay Lin  better, Joce finally has a chance to escape, and seems to do so without  hesitation. The accountant concludes she's gotten everything out of Kay  Lin she can, takes the sharpened end of her bat, and impales her through  the torso. Then Joce thwacks the accountant over the head; apparently Joce had just gone off to get herself a blunt object, and came back a *bit* too late.

Concluding the flashback-thoughts, Joce recalls that she grew up wanting to be there for someone because no one ever was for her. However, as she carries an unconscious and profusely-bleeding Kay Lin away, Joce concludes that being a hero is fucking terrifying and she never wants to do this again.

A challenge-summons-earthquake accentuates the panic. Joce runs into the alliance, now headed by WR (and Sequitur tagging along); they try to take Kay Lin, and though Joce resists on instinct, she helplessly relents. Sequitur says something vaguely comforting as Joce, succumbing to exhaustion and overwhelm, loses her composure a bit.

### also of note
- As for how Kay Lin waking up proves anything: in reality, a blow to the head hard enough to leave someone unconscious for several minutes is enough to inflict severe brain trauma, if not [kill them outright](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TapOnTheHead). While this story doesn't adhere strictly to normal biological functions (it's noted early on that no one ever seems to feel hungry), the point is that That Should Have Killed Her but it didn't.
- Kay Lin is bound at least in part by the loose linen-wraps she was already wearing. On the neck and arms, they were covering a few scars.
- Regarding threats of physical harm: the accountant remarks that she'd like to test just how this ~physical endurance~ can go, but is no sadist, hates getting her hands dirty, and frankly doesn't see the point in leaving someone writhing in agony while she's trying to make them *talk*. She's rather casual about the whole affair, really.
- If you've seen Disney cartoon *Amphibia*, (spoilers for the second season finale) <span class="spoiler">I do solemnly swear I had the "Kay Lin confesses to having lied the whole time (out of loneliness), then gets violently stabbed" plot point *before* watching "True Colors." Happy coincidence, though :D</span>
- The alliance group doesn't exactly welcome Joce with open arms, but WR steps forward. It's a brief impression, all in all.
- Joce ditches the military shirt outfit after this. It's bloodstained to hell anyway.

## 9
An unspecified amount of time later (probably like a day or two?), Kay Lin wakes up; Joce is resting nearby, as she apparently does a lot. Kay Lin immediately gets worked up, though it physically hurts.

The alliance, which at this point is smaller and constitutes a majority of remaining players (rabbits have picked off quite a few in the interim, especially loners), has offered the duo refuge. More specifically, current leader WR has; others' opinions vary (if they have any at all), though Joce has managed to make small talk with the local medic/s. (Her own sprain has also been bandaged up.)

Joce asks Kay Lin for more details on previous games; Kay Lin complies. She and her girlfriend Em signed up together, made it to the end, and of course one wasn't going to leave without the other. Although they were going to try staying here indefinitely, one morning Kay Lin woke up to Em trying to kill herself; Em had been "infected" with white-rot, previously hidden to Kay Lin. When they scaled the entire Beacon and found nothing of use, they agreed to mutual suicide; however, when Kay Lin's eyes were closed, Em jumped.

Kay Lin has never seen the "game over" options that Joce and others report when "killed;" instead, Kay Lin just wakes up time and time again in a new round, no matter how she died before. She thinks something might be different this round, just because no one's approached her like Joce has. Joce vows to get her out, though Kay Lin resists; Joce gives her the pendant (which the accountant dropped earlier), and Kay Lin tells Joce to leave before she breaks down again.

Joce reports all this back to WR, which seems to be a regular thing. WR talks now (albeit still rarely), and invites Joce to join her and a small group out for rabbit-hunting. During the activity, WR teaches Joce an alternate technique, in which she essentially uses herself as "bait" while everyone else closes in; as one of the sturdier people here, she can hold the creatures back longer.

Although that's a good time, the next challenge is a tug-o-war, which puts Joce and WR on opposite sides. Joce tries to argue for everyone dropping the rope, consequence be damned; at the last moment, WR complies, and enough others follow suit that anyone left trying is easily stopped. The setting bursts and crumbles as apparent punishment, but through a coordinated effort, everyone makes it out alive. (From this point on the earthquakes are far more frequent, making drastic changes to the landscape overnight.)

Despite that, the players throw a celebratory campfire. Joce is invited to join WR and Sequitur, who seem to be close; Joce invites Kay Lin over, and (for seemingly unrelated reasons) WR gets up to go help someone shortly after. At Kay Lin's prompting, Sequitur confirms they and WR are childhood friends, but backtracks on revealing anything else; they've both changed a lot.

Kay Lin excuses herself, seeming off; when Joce follows her, she recalls 
a time she and Em were out for a walk, Em was way ahead, and when Kay Lin
 caught up Em was trying to free a rabbit (a normal bunny) from a snare. 
The image sticks out to Kay Lin of that disgusting, pathetic, dying 
little creature and how gently Em was holding it. Anyway, random story; 
she tells Joce to go rejoin the festives, and send Sequitur her way.

Later that evening, Joce returns to find Kay Lin gone. Sequitur, clearly talking around something, directs her towards a ledge where WR likes to "stargaze" (not that this sky has anything but haze). Joce gets a bit lost on the way, but ends up seeing/hearing from a distance: WR is indeed alone, possibly unmasked (though without light and from a distance, Joce can't make out a face), and Kay Lin steps up from behind. She's holding the pendant close.

"Emery?"

### also of note
- Kay Lin had shorter hair in flashbacks with Em. When she approaches WR at the end, it's around the same length (albeit messier) and she's changed her outfit.
- When Joce swears she'll try to get Kay Lin out, Kay Lin's reply is something like "Don't make promises you can't keep."
- During the campfire talk, there's also a little banter about what everyone was doing with their lives. Sequitur was a mall hairdresser but had recently been laid off; they'd found out about the game through niche corners of the internet, and didn't actually expect to get in. Kay Lin clarifies she was *aiming* for medical school (not too enthusiastically), but was on the verge of dropping out. (She also seems to have no idea quarantine is a thing that's been happening; her excuse is that she lives under a rock anyway.)
- Joce questions Em leaving Kay Lin behind on the walk; Kay Lin quickly defends her, saying they normally stayed close but they'd just been having... *disagreements,* lately. It's skimmed over.

## 10
Kay Lin has concluded that WR = Em, which she's suspected from their first encounter (inadvertent, in the background of Addison's alliance proposal in part 2) but she hasn't gotten a better look until recent. She also thought Em might've forgotten her, but Em knowing Sequitur suggests otherwise.

WR remains turned away, says nothing, and refuses to take the pendant back. Kay Lin starts out cautiously hopeful, then gets desperately frustrated and demand-begs for "Em" to acknowledge her in any way. WR finally shoves the pendant back, stands up, and leaves.

Joce intercepts, and WR confirms in frustration that, yes, she is Em, and also there is more to her and Kay Lin's story than Joce has probably heard. Namely, coming here at all was Kay Lin's idea, as was the death pact. She tells Joce to get some rest, and swears to explain later; Joce, having been shoved back the last couple times she reached out to Kay Lin, reluctantly agrees.

Instead Sequitur is the one who finds Kay Lin having a nervous breakdown. Though at first she's not sure how to respond to them, she then pulls them close and says she knows how they can make her feel better.

Em, masked again, announces to Joce that Sequitur and Kay Lin are gone. She gives Joce a bat, tells someone to be on guard, and the two trek out. There's some kind of trail that's probably intentional.

Kay Lin and Sequitur are in another secluded underground space, and apparently loopy as shit. As thanks for the good time, Kay Lin breaks her bottle and hands it over; she'd like them to put her out of her misery. When Sequitur resists, she uses the crumbling cavern to trap them, and repeats the demand. Randos and rabbits don't do it, and apparently she can't finish herself off either. She trusts Sequitur, though.

There are rabbits aplenty on the trail, though Em and Joce work well together bruteforcing past. They're almost having fun. Meanwhile, Sequitur refuses Kay Lin repeatedly; when they won't even fake-agree, just to fake her out and run for help, she starts pressing the glass very, very close. They're in this compromising position when Em smashes through and goes straight to Sequitur; Joce holds Kay Lin back, though it's only dubiously necessary. Kay Lin says something about Joce never leaving her, which makes Joce drop her instantly.

Em, supporting Sequitur, beckons for Joce to leave as more rabbits close in. Kay Lin doesn't follow, however; Joce turns at the last second, as Em triggers a cave-in that takes them and the rabbits straight down.

### also of note
- Em's "mask" is kinda like a voluntary growth. She typically wears a bandana to cover the lower half of her face; as Joce sees, Em's jaw got kinda fucked up at some point.
- Em doesn't have to try hard to wake Joce, the latter of whom is only lightly sleeping. It's more like: Em passes by the room, says "They're gone," and that is *all* Joce needs to get up and join her.
- I'm not sure if this needs to be onscreen (and if so, around where to fit it in), but for what it's worth, the scene where Kay Lin shows Em the flyer advertising the game is *loaded* with subtext. The gist of it is that Kay Lin, failing academically and aimless in life in general, has latched on *hard* to Em as a source of comfort and purpose. Em is not super comfortable with this, but seems resigned to it; when she's hesitant to sign up, Kay Lin's mood crashes, and Em's quick to reassure her. Kay Lin isn't *un*aware that this is an uneasy dynamic, but she's not letting go first either.
- You bet your fuckin ass that Kay Lin standing over Sequitur is a direct and obvious parallel to what she did with Joce after killing Caleb. She's just a liiiittle more frustrated this time.

- tentative title: "[You can't save her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8XN7eoZr0Y)"

To the alliance, Em reports that Kay Lin has basically gone batshit, is manipulating Joce into defending her, and may cause greater destruction if not controlled. After dispatching search parties, Em leaves in a different direction—to fix the problem at its source.

Underground, after blearily taking a small drink (implicitly from another "game over," though it's unclear), Joce finds the rabbits obliterated and Kay Lin gone. There's another trail of some sort, and as Joce follows it she can't shake the feeling she's being watched. (Which is omnipresent, always, but especially bad now.)

The trail abruptly ends, though there's an exit nearby. Around here Joce runs into one of the search parties, her medic-acquaintance included; Joce is happy to go back with them until they talk about Kay Lin. Naturally they don't believe Joce's defense, and more rabbits attack. (They really don't like all these earthquakes and cave-ins.) Though Joce fights with the group, she refuses to leave with them, and they're left with no choice but die together or run; they leave. Someone drags Joce back underground just as a final rabbit lunges, and the exit caves in.

The culprit is the accountant, who just wants to talk. Joce disregards her until she reveals she's been physically picking up the trail. The accountant "thanks" Joce for the opportunity to stay down here and investigate deeper forever. Her motive has always been to determine what draws people to this place, why they linger. On occasion Joce engages the accountant's rambling; namely, Joce admits to feeling like she *has* to save Kay Lin. It's also mentioned, in passing, that winners typically (or at least the accountant can personally attest) get no grand prize; they just see the same "game over" prompt as anyone else who "dies."

Eventually they reach an area by the base of the Beacon; paths aboveground have collapsed, though there's a way through and up the center. The accountant helps Joce clear the path and bids her farewell.

No sooner is Joce inside is she joined by another not-zombie, this time Addison—or at least, the semi-demented shell of a person who presumably is supposed to be Addison. She repeatedly mistakes Joce for WR and babbles about being stuck in limbo; if she leaves she'll have accomplished nothing, but is staying worthwhile? Joce berates her for being passive, self-pitying, and lost, which convinces Addison to try again. And again. And again.

And again. (Joce doesn't recognize it, but she's essentially dry-drowning.) Although Joce tries to apologize, it's useless. People who refuse to go are turned into unrecognizable hellrabbits.

Just as "Addison"/the rabbit backs Joce into a corner, Em intervenes with a bat to the rabbit-skull. (It's not lethal.) She offers to save Joce, but Joce refuses; Em wants to bring her back, but Joce wants to scale the Beacon to get to Kay Lin. Then the rabbit rises again.

Thus begins a hellish waltz of Joce just trying to get by, Em trying to stop her *and* lure the rabbit around like a bullfighter to block Joce's way. At one point the rabbit turns on Em; Joce grabs Em and pulls her aside at the last moment, which puts Joce in a vulnerable position. Em looks almost ready to kill her but freezes. Joce escapes, and Em bashes the rabbit's head in with prejudice.

At the peak, Kay Lin has been waiting. She reiterates her offer/demand; she thinks that, if Joce finishes what Em started, she'll finally be allowed to die. (Even if it's not permanent, it'd be cathartic.) The alternative: Kay Lin uses some type of control (a mirror of what's at the bottom) and destroys this whole place. As extra incentive, the Beacon itself is falling apart. Better hurry up, or Joce won't save *anyone*.

Joce has another idea. She first "hugs" Kay Lin, throwing away the weapon/pendant in the process—then steps back, apologizes, and falls backward off the Beacon. Her last thought, going down, is that if she's wrong, this is gonna suck.

### also of note
- Between Em's talk to the alliance and her own leave, Sequitur points out that it sounds like she's trying to get Kay Lin killed. Em doesn't respond to that, or even suggests it'd be doing KL a favor.
- Fun thing the accountant says to Joce: "You know, I've always wanted to know what it's like for a piece of my skull to be half out of my head and half lodged into my brain! Thank you so much!"
- On Joce needing to save Kay Lin, the accountant's reply: "What, from herself?" Joce doesn't answer.
- Before parting, the accountant provides her actual name (*Diana*, though she thinks it's old-fashioned and never uses it), and allows Joce a final question. Joce asks "Who's Terry?" and Diana is *delighted* Joce remembered; "Terrance is my deadbeat brother." She never did understand that guy. Threw his whole life away, and for what!
- The accountant, as a side note, intends to stay down here for the foreseeable future. She's barely scratched the surface.
- It's possible Addison's word salad has something to do with betrayal. Depends on how much her earlier demise is shown? Regardless, she clearly did not die the hero's death Caleb claimed.
- The transformation confirms that "zombie" Gary was in a state between human and rabbit.
- When Em intervenes, she offers Joce a hand. The spotlight from above makes her look all grandiose. "I'm here to save you."
- Later, when she catches herself about to kill Joce: "This place—these *people*—infect you. Do you think you're a fucking hero?"
- For extra hell there can be a *split* second of Em facing down the rabbit one last time, where the rabbit hesitates. But Em bats it without mercy.
- At the end, Kay Lin is wearing the pendant; not sure if she puts it on before this. She's got that eerily blank attitude for most of her talk, though it falters as Joce hesitates—and breaks entirely at the end.
- Joce's last words to Kay Lin: "I'm sorry you have to see this again."

### author's note/a hopefully-unnecessary clarification
I am HOPING it is clear that Joce didn't take a backwards stroll to "kill herself," in the same sense as Kay Lin wants to die. I want to make a distinction between "death" in the context of this abstracted game, and "actual" death as self-obliteration. The latter is psychologically lethal; the former, debatable.

Less abstractly, here's a table:

&nbsp; | you win | you haven't won
continue | new game | white-rot sets in; the more you do this, the worse it gets, culminating in rabbit
quit | \[unclear; go home?] | \[unclear; presumably, you just fade/melt]

(Not that things have to be *that* clear. Just, y'know, if it looks like the narrative is ~condoning suicide~ or whatever then That Was Not Intended.)

Of course, at this point in the story, there's no proof that quitting =/= Existn't. That said, there are still giant question marks around Em and Kay Lin's situations. That's what next installment is for.

(Also, I... have not figured out the *specific* little things responsible for said situations. It's probably connected to the "control" machinations, at the apex of the Beacon and its inverse. Some kind of lock? And obviously this would've been foreshadowed at the *very* beginning too, except it isn't since, again, still figuring it out. Bear with me.)

## 12
- tentative title: "I miss you"
	- or past tense, "I missed you"? I like the ongoing-ness of the present more, though

Again: game over. Splitting pain makes continuation, just for a drop, mighty tempting. But Joce slams to "quit," and her hand bursts from real glass.

She sits up from a chamber, which quickly drains, in the center of a sterile room; the wall-screen behind her buzzes to static, then fades to blank. Joce is very much alive.

There are two doors; one's to an exit, and it's open and blindingly bright. The other, open a crack, leads further into... wherever this is.

Dozens of identical doors and rooms line an artificial hall. Some are empty as the one Joce left, lights off and exit doors closed; in others, light shines upon figures curled in full chambers, the walls behind them offering a glimpse into how they see the world.

The eerie silence is interrupted by a cry, not unlike those goddamn rabbits but distinctly more human. Joce follows it to a room flashing radioactive, door mangled and ajar. A sickly yellow substance clouds the central chamber, spilling out from cracked seams. <!--lmao this reaaaaally stopped being a sentence a scene but it's the end, couldn't help it. I'll duplicate this page for revisions probably--> Looks like someone's tried breaking it but had second thoughts.

The screen only offers static, but between the white noise there's no mistaking the voice. Kay Lin is bereaved. (This is around where Joce starts doing the mechanism-modification thing. Something's been messed with.) Essentially, she apologizes profusely (hell knows to who), and is sickened with herself for driving not one but *two* people off the edge with her refusal to let go. She's gotten so much worse here and has gotten a harsh lesson in what indulging that means. Mostly, even though she doesn't think she deserves it, she wants to move on.

*Click.* Something flickers into view. Something warm, a delirious haze of comforting ecstasy, maybe a hug that she always runs into without second thought—and the bleak, aching hollow of leaving it all behind. But the embrace is an illusion, and Kay Lin falls back into oblivion.

She wakes up gasping. As she gets her bearings, she notices the door further in is ajar; pulled closed, but not all the way. Without thinking she scrambles for it, grabs the handle—but stops herself.

"Thank you! And... goodbye."

It's left ambiguous whether Joce hears this. Her own exit has closed.

&nbsp;

The in-game setting is in shambles. The Beacon has split and fallen to pieces. Sequitur wanders towards a dark crevice, where one of the starting burrows must have been. They found something of Em's—her bat, maybe the pendant (or at least a piece of it; the northward tip, at least, is gone). They ask if this was worth it. From within, the reply: "I did the right thing. Didn't I?"

Largely without prompting, Em continues to talk more than she ever has. "She had no one else but me. What was I supposed to do, let her die?" Em couldn't bring herself to go back, but "If I hadn't intervened, she wouldn't have made it." Sequitur only has one reply: "I dunno, Em. You think *I'll* make it?"

They turn to leave; suddenly there's a rabbit over them, maw encasing them but not quite clamping down. Its crooked teeth spell out, if you squint, "DON'T GO."

&nbsp;

Same old house, same old city. Joce, whose room is now accented by the ephemera of new hobbies, is gardening when her housemate delivers some mail. She takes it, skims, hands one back. "*Them* again?" "Shred it." The sound is music to her ears.

The housemate returns this time though, and warily suggests she write back—not for actual sending, just as something that might help. (It's implied if not outright stated they had a falling out with the second housemate they were seen with in the intro.) Though Joce is wary, the contents of the letter form a voiceover narrative (and have for the entire story, sporadically) that frames the entire ending montage, which spans months. She's talking to people, getting out, trying things. Bonding with this one housemate for sure, but also other complete strangers. (Taking meds, as a background detail.) It ain't all sunshine and roses, but it's progress.

In a final note, she admits she still thinks about Sal a lot. But lately, it's hasn't been this big terrifying thing that leaves her on edge for days, it's just something that happened.

### also of note
- The "chambers" are glass, cylindrical—might even look like bottles because of course they would.
- During Em's rant/monologue, she mentions out of left field that Kay Lin wanted Em to meet KL's parents. Em is still incredulous about this. Evidently they were not on the same wavelength about a few things. (Implicitly, this is what they were having (wholly-unspoken-)conflict over when the rabbit-snare scene took place.)
- Joce is wearing a foot brace at the end. Sometimes re-exacerbating a strain, repeatedly and with little rest, has consequences. But it's healing.
- The poster in Joce's room is still there, but gradually joined by notes, photographs, other nice little things. Eventually it gets taken down altogether, although there's still *some* piece of the series she keeps around.
- Why gardening? Besides the ~growth~ imagery, scrap paper makes excellent compost.
- It could be implied Joce meets up with one or two people from the game again? It'd be that medic-acquaintance and other background randos though, definitely no one major.
