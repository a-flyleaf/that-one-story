Part divisions are subject to change, especially around the middle, but for the sake of scope I would really like to not break 12. That said, lengths vary.

After a couple rewrites of varying lengths and amounts of expressiveness, I've settled on what I hope is a happy medium: about a sentence a scene, with additional notes at the end of each part for visually- and/or thematically-significant details. \[also I challenged myself to write each part in half and hour because HOO FUCKIN BOY did it get out of hand otherwise]

## 1
tentative title: "Relapse"

Players wake up in a panopticon-esque underground and are introduced to the game: many have entered, one will win, and the winner can go home.

Protagonist Joce lives a predictable, bare-minimum lifestyle, which quickly becomes stifling when quarantine hits. She's also sustained a minor ankle sprain; inspired by videos of parkour, she took a route she shouldn't have. When she returns to her room, two housemates (apparently a couple, one more thoughtful than the other) are in her room. They give her a couple letters: a letter from "Skoal," which is quickly shoved in a drawer full of unopened letters from the same sender, and a flyer inviting her to the thrill of her dreams. Joce thinks it's a scam, but can't stand the monotony. She glances up at the one sign of personality in her room: above her bed, a worn poster of a gritty action hero.

Back in-game, one player has started rallying the others; when she calls on Joce, Joce ignores it. However, when the grandstander picks on a small girl curled up in a corner (who also doesn't respond, to the speaker's frustration), Joce takes notice.

One player has found food. Joce stands over them, intimidating.

Joce places the morsel by the girl, then stands back, thinking about how the world is unfair, every person for themselves—but the strong are morally obliged to look after the less fortunate. The girl interrupts the internal monologue to ask what Joce is staring at. Joce, immediately taken off-guard, claims she was standing guard, which the girl doesn't buy because no one was paying attention. She offers the scrap to Joce; when Joce turns it down, the girl mentions it only takes days to starve, less without water. Joce thinks she's a little young to know that; the girl claims she went to med school, or was going to. She introduces herself as "Kay Lin" (two-word first name) and offers a handshake; Joce, clearly not used to this, returns it.

Meanwhile, someone in the crowd suggests that no one has to die. The underground abruptly starts flooding; with an earthquake and an ear-splitting alarm, the first challenge starts: escape. Joce grabs Kay Lin and runs for the more difficult but straightforward path. As players scramble to ascend, Joce thinks she's got this; then someone (necklace-wearing, the only detail Joce notices) falls to their apparent death below, and then Joce freezes. Kay Lin stops, u-turns, and reaches out; although this invokes a penalty, the two make it out by working together. (In the background, there's an exchange along the lines of "Come on, Terry!" "Who?" "Gary!")

When players reach the surface, they're rewarded by supplies and weapons (a baseball bat)—except for Joce and Kay Lin, who as per penalty get jack shit. Joce leaves, Kay Lin follows; the camera lingers on a white-rotted hand rising from below.

Trekking through the hazy, barren landscape, Joce insists there is no "we," and since she doesn't answer Kay Lin's questions about her own motives, Kay Lin won't answer hers. She also insists she doesn't need shelter. Their banter is interrupted by what sounds like someone crying, a strangled wail; Joce approaches despite Kay Lin's hesitation. The noise comes from a crevice underground; when Joce speaks, a humanoid rabbit-monster bursts out and lunges at her. Joce is absolutely no match and is quickly chased down. For a split second, she thinks she sees a human face in its mouth; the rabbit clamps down, and she blacks out.

A "game over" screen flashes, along with two options: continue, quit. Though frazzled, Joce refuses to entertain the idea of leaving when Kay Lin is still in there, and slams continue; it produces a small drink.

Joce finds the rabbit dead, semi-melted into the ground. It was being choked by the same necklace as the first to fall, and has been blasted by some ambiguous warm liquid. Kay Lin's on standby, apparently having triggered the blast by using rubble to smash a nearby rock formation. Joce demands to know how she knew; Kay Lin admits she's familiar with this place, but doesn't know why she's here. (J: "Like an NPC." KL: "What? No—" J: "I'm joking. Partially.") Joce relents, and they leave to find shelter.

Meanwhile, the grandstander, Addison, has kept a small group around, including a small boy Caleb who she lent a hand and now refuses to leave her side. (Minor detail: Addison's outfit has changed, and now includes an eight-pointed star pendant.) The group is approached by a rabbit-figure, apparently the owner of the white-rotted hand; mostly human, sans skull-mask. "White Rabbit" (WR) doesn't talk, but indicates they want to join the group; when Addison hesitates, WR takes her bat and smashes a nearby structure, blasting a hellrabbit no one noticed was there. Addison relents. ("...Sold. Welcome aboard.")

Joce and Kay Lin have taken refuge somewhere high-up, which feels exposed but allows decent lookout. As Kay Lin sleeps, Joce realizes she can't leave her behind: for one thing, Kay Lin is either an invaluable ally or a too-knowledgeable enemy. But on a base level, Joce still feels the need to keep her safe. (Joce has also sustained a small ring of white-rot around one finger since the game over. She can't tell if there's any on Kay Lin.) Despite all this, if there can only be one winner, Joce is sure they're doomed. For now, best not to think about it.
