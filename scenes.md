Part divisions are subject to change, especially around the middle, but for the sake of scope I would really like to not break 12. That said, lengths vary.

I rewrote this like three times at varying lengths and amounts of expressiveness. (You can read them [here]({%include url.html%}/oldversions) if you want.) What I've settled on is **about a sentence a scene**. Since this inevitably leaves details out, there's also an "additional notes" section below each part, for recurring themes and other Things That Will Be Relevant Later.
