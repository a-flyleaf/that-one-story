Part divisions are subject to change, especially around the middle, but for the sake of scope I would really like to not break 12. That said, lengths vary.

After a couple rewrites of varying lengths and amounts of expressiveness, I've settled on what I hope is a happy medium: about a sentence a scene, with additional notes at the end of each part for visually- and/or thematically-significant details. \[also I challenged myself to write each part in half and hour because HOO FUCKIN BOY did it get out of hand otherwise]

## 1
tentative title: "Relapse"

Players wake up in a panopticon-esque underground and are introduced to the game: many have entered, one will win, and the winner can go home. Have fun!

Protagonist Joce lives a predictable, bare-minimum lifestyle, which quickly becomes stifling when quarantine hits. She's also sustained a minor ankle sprain; inspired by videos of parkour, she took a route she shouldn't have. When she returns to her room, two housemates (apparently a couple, one more thoughtful than the other) are in her room. They give her a couple letters: a letter from "Salvador," which is quickly shoved in a drawer full of unopened letters from the same sender, and a flyer inviting her to the thrill of her dreams. Joce thinks it's a scam, but can't stand the monotony. She glances up at the one sign of personality in her room: above her bed, a worn poster of a gritty action hero.

Back in-game, one player has started rallying the others; when she calls on Joce, Joce ignores it. However, when the grandstander picks on a small girl curled up in a corner (who also doesn't respond, to the speaker's frustration), Joce takes notice.

One player has found food. Joce stands over them, intimidating.

Joce places the morsel by the girl, then stands back, thinking about how the world is unfair, every person for themselves—but the strong are morally obliged to look after the less fortunate. The girl interrupts the internal monologue to ask what Joce is staring at. Joce, immediately taken off-guard, claims she was standing guard, which the girl doesn't buy because no one was paying attention. She offers the scrap to Joce; when Joce turns it down, the girl mentions it only takes days to starve, less without water. Joce thinks she's a little young to know that; the girl claims she went to med school, or was going to. She introduces herself as "Kay Lin" (two-word first name) and offers a handshake; Joce, clearly not used to this, returns it.

Meanwhile, someone in the crowd suggests that no one has to die. The underground abruptly starts flooding; with an earthquake and an ear-splitting alarm, the first challenge starts: escape. Joce grabs Kay Lin and runs for the more difficult but straightforward path. As players scramble to ascend, Joce thinks she's got this; then someone (necklace-wearing, the only detail Joce notices) falls to their apparent death below, and then Joce freezes. Kay Lin stops, u-turns, and reaches out; although this invokes a penalty, the two make it out by working together. (In the background, there's an exchange along the lines of "Come on, Terry!" "Who?" "Gary!")

When players reach the surface, they're rewarded by supplies and weapons (a baseball bat)—except for Joce and Kay Lin, who as per penalty get jack shit. Joce leaves, Kay Lin follows; the camera lingers on a white-rotted hand rising from below.

Trekking through the hazy, barren landscape, Joce insists there is no "we," and since she doesn't answer Kay Lin's questions about her own motives (the letter was inviting her to a "VR" test/experience, but she won't answer anything personal), Kay Lin won't answer hers. She also insists she doesn't need shelter. Their banter is interrupted by what sounds like someone crying, a strangled wail; Joce approaches despite Kay Lin's hesitation. The noise comes from a crevice underground; when Joce speaks, a humanoid rabbit-monster bursts out and lunges at her. Joce is absolutely no match and is quickly chased down. For a split second, she thinks she sees a human face in its mouth; the rabbit clamps down, and she blacks out.

A "game over" screen flashes, along with two options: continue, quit. Though frazzled, Joce refuses to entertain the idea of leaving when Kay Lin is still in there, and slams continue; it produces a small drink.

Joce wakes to the rabbit dead, semi-melted into the ground. It was being choked by the same necklace as the first to fall, and has been blasted by some ambiguous warm liquid. Kay Lin's on standby, apparently having triggered the blast by using rubble to smash a nearby rock formation. Joce demands to know how she knew; Kay Lin admits she's familiar with this place, but doesn't know why she's here. (J: "Like an NPC." KL: "What? No—" J: "I'm joking. Partially.") Joce relents, and they leave to find shelter.

Meanwhile, the grandstander, Addison, has kept a small group around, including a small boy Caleb who she lent a hand and now refuses to leave her side. (Minor detail: Addison's outfit has changed, and now includes an eight-pointed star pendant.) The group is approached by a rabbit-figure, apparently the owner of the white-rotted hand; mostly human, sans skull-mask. "White Rabbit" (WR) doesn't talk, but indicates they want to join the group; when Addison hesitates, WR takes her bat and smashes a nearby structure, blasting a hellrabbit no one noticed was there. Addison relents. ("...Sold. Welcome aboard.")

Joce and Kay Lin have taken refuge somewhere high-up, which feels exposed but allows decent lookout. As Kay Lin sleeps, Joce realizes she can't leave her behind: for one thing, Kay Lin is either an invaluable ally or a too-knowledgeable enemy. But on a base level, Joce still feels the need to keep her safe. (Joce has also sustained a small ring of white-rot around one finger since the game over. She can't tell if there's any on Kay Lin.) Despite all this, if there can only be one winner, Joce is sure they're doomed. For now, best not to think about it.

## 2
Night at the alliance base. Another tall person in a(n obviously-fake) mask, "Wolf," is trying to ask Addison about logistics. Meanwhile, WR is helping allies set up camp. Addison pulls WR aside.

Out of earshot, Addison admits she has no idea what she's doing, but doesn't expect the alliance to last anyway. However, she wants WR to be a "true" ally; she "reminds" WR that, had she not spoken up, WR would have been attacked on sight. For now, people are still listening to her. "And *you*... you know how to pitch a tent." Addison offers a handshake to seal the deal.

Joce wakes up and is annoyed to find this was not in fact some giant nightmare. She resumes her trek from yesterday; back at base (marked by the Beacon, the tallest structure around; it resembles the red north arrow of a compass), there was a map, and Joce wants to see just how far this land extends. She also has Kay Lin tell her more about the rabbits and this place; supposedly, rabbits are attracted to noise, but if blasted by whatever's in these rocks (which is triggered by any sort of breakage; some structures are easier to crack than others), they melt. They brainstorm techniques for dispatching any further rabbits without weaponry; Joce does most of the talking, and is mildly disappointed by the peaceful journey.

Meanwhile, Addison has gathered a small crew (WR, Wolf, a third "guard," and Caleb insisted on tagging along) to return to the Beacon for supplies and "further planning." (She seems to be bluffing, to avoid dealing with minituitae at camp.) Joce and Kay Lin enter, Joce baffled; Addison has the crew approach & subtly corner them.

Addison offers a reintroduction and offers a handshake; Joce ignores it and gives her a fake name. Addison suggests Joce join the group for her own good; Joce points out that Addison has been ignoring Kay Lin, and though Addison tries to half-ass an extended invite, Caleb interjects to call Joce rude (and Kay Lin a creep, for just standing there staring at her). Wolf tries to shut him up; there's wailing outside. Joce has moved to higher ground to get a better look; however, Addison follows, and tries to repeat her "true alliance" offer. Joce insults her, saying she's not interested in being another shoulder accessory/bodyguard, and that Addison is everything wrong with people today: using others as means, ego fuel, and ignoring the rest.

While they're talking at each other, rabbits enter the scene. Caleb and Kay Lin are shoved in a semi-underground space for safety, while the guard trio try to fight back. Despite each person being individually strong, they're barely coordinated; WR on defense, Wolf on offense, and third trying to help whoever's closest. At one point they rely on Wolf as backup; Wolf fails to provide, and the third is chomped by a rabbit.

Joce has started trying to escape; Addison stopped following after the insults, but in the wake of the third's demise (their body goes still, decapitated standing, then drops), a rabbit gets close to Addison. Joce dispatches it/pulls her away, then gets down for good; she grabs Kay Lin (offers Caleb an opening too, which he doesn't take) and makes a run for it.

As Joce and Kay Lin leave, Joce asks why Kay Lin didn't tell her about the landscape looping. Kay Lin asks why Joce gave Addison a fake name; Joce's response amounts to "was she listening?"; she doesn't like people knowing things about her, period. That said, Kay Lin knows the real name, and now Joce wants an answer. However, Kay Lin points out that Joce wasn't listening to *her* much earlier anyway; after some protest, Joce dryly apologizes, with something to the effect of "I'll heed your every word from now on, my liege." Then musters something more genuine. Finally answering, Kay Lin shrugs; she claims she just never noticed.

Back at the alliance, Addison is still agitated. Wolf has nothing kind to say about her; Caleb's the only one claiming defense, and he's annoying everyone about it including Addison. She tries making a speech clarifying and apologizing for the situation, but it sounds phony and makes matters worse.

That night, Addison returns to the Beacon solo, and finds that the underground is no longer flooded. She hears someone following, assumes it's WR, and rant-monologues; it's unclear whether she's more upset about the death, her own incompetence, or Joce pointing it out. In conclusion, she's down here because she's hoping to find something that can control this place so everyone will love her again—and, more genuinely, so she can be someone worth saving.

Caleb thinks she already is. After the initial "oh my god you did NOT hear all that" and "dude stop stalking me," Caleb claims he wants her to come back; Addison insists she's got to make this trip worthwhile first, and so down they go. They manage a calmer talk about motives; Caleb's here because he's been bullied his whole life and wants to get stronger, and Addison's just a politician's daughter and wanted to make some kind of name for herself. Implicitly that parent is out a lot; Caleb promises *he'd* never leave, which is not super comforting.

Even deeper down, they find some kind of intricate mechanism, which Caleb notices Addison's pendant could unlock. At this point Addison is ready to turn around, but Caleb insists she try it. She relents, which triggers a cave-in/flood. Caleb grabs the pendant but it's no use. While escaping, they reach a crossroads; Caleb is frozen, and when Addison tries to push him one way, he flees down the other. Then the space collapses.

Cut to the ground shaking above; another siren-summons beckons players to the Beacon for the second challenge. Joce notices Caleb alone and more distraught than usual. (Minor detail, won't be noticeable until next part: Caleb's wearing the pendant now.) As the instructions begin, Caleb has an outburst: Addison is dead. Joce takes pity on him; Kay Lin, among a majority of players, find this annoying as hell. Let the games begin!

## 3
With some fumbling, players figure the game out: in groups of about 5, one person is designated outlier, and one clue indicates who it is. After a timed deilberation, players vote on who they think is the odd one out; if the outlier is among the last two standing, the outlier wins, but if the outlier is voted, remaining players win. Winners from each round move up to the next level, and those who reach the top are promised grand rewards. (Elimination isn't fatal.)

Joce and Kay Lin are grouped with Caleb, Wolf, and a fifth (dubbed "lookalike" as their only discernible detail has some passing resemblance to Kay Lin; it's vague and they are not related). From the getgo, Caleb accuses Joce of essentially getting Addison killed from throwing her off all day; Wolf is hyperaggressive, but Kay Lin points out this has nothing to do with the challenge and shifts focus to Caleb. He's voted out unanimously, but not the outlier. In the second round, Wolf turns on Joce, whose attempt at self-defense is shaky; Kay Lin points out that the lookalike hasn't said anything either, and though the lookalike is calm at first, they accidentally give themselves away and cave. Game done.

In the interim, Wolf seems to have claimed control of the alliance; Joce decides not to go anywhere near them. Kay Lin asks why Joce didn't use her as a scapegoat, which would've been easy; Joce didn't doesn't reply, and the next game begins.

Game two: Joce is grouped with the suited person who, in the background of the first challenge, was working with Gary. Suit person (aka "the accountant") reads the room with ease, and Joce inadvertently teams up with her as they both seem to be innocent. However, they're the last two standing, and the accountant claims victory as the outlier. It's a quick game. Joce is eliminated.

Among the eliminated stragglers, Kay Lin is already out, and Caleb is trying to convince everyone Joce is a threat. It's unclear how much headway he's making; Joce's paranoia suggests it's nearly everyone. Gary steps in, sick of the drama, and invites her and anyone else who wants no part in it to join him at his place. Joce is wary, but rabbits outside convince her otherwise.

Gary and the accountant are still together, and once at the house, Joce decides to investigate. She sends Kay Lin off to get a read on whether people are actually suspicious, which is mostly an excuse to make Kay Lin stop shadowing her. While exploring, Joce determines that the house hasn't been lived in (there are no electrical outlets, no ephemera, barren rooms). There's a locked study, and though she finds an odd path underground, she trips on uneven flooring and reaggravates the sprain. Kay Lin catches up and claims no one seems to care; Joce doesn't buy it, and refuses to let her look at the injury. It's confirmation this isn't as removed from the "real world" as Joce thought it was.

The accountant, alerted by the ruckus, interrupts them both to announce drinks are being served. Implication: attendance is mandatory. And someone wants to talk to them.

## 4
Joce tells Kay Lin not to take a sip. She waves it off; it makes her "all red and fucked up."

Caleb is at the table; apparently he showed up while Joce was busy, having been kicked out of the alliance (or walked out; his story contradicts itself in favor of self-pity). He "apologizes" to Joce for getting overwhelmed and accusing her baselessly or at least kind of baseless because she *was* pretty rude and well really who can blame him he's had a long day and—Joce waves it off.

Caleb doesn't hesitate to take a few swigs, and though it doesn't make him or anyone else drop dead, the drink seems to take people's inhibitions down a notch. He tries to make small talk, which Joce mostly disregards but increasingly irritates Kay Lin; when she mutters something insulting, Joce gives her a nudge, and Caleb pipes in like "Yeah, *Kayla,* why are you so meaaaaan to me? You should listen to your girlfriend :(" Kay Lin is fucking *infuriated* (playing to the "She is NOT my—!" trope, albeit less embarrassed and more as if Caleb just killed her dog), but sits down when she notices she spilled her drink on Joce. Joce gets up and leaves the table.

For such a big dining hall it's stupid hard to find the exit, especially with people getting louder and closer all around. The scenery slips away, ceding to spilled drinks, shattered glass, uncomfortable intimacy; taller figures draw near, and flashbacks and present melt into one. People are taking notice; in a slurry of abstraction, it's unclear how much of this is imagined. Joce can't get away fast enough.

Kay Lin finds her pacing outside, more agitated than ever. Joce tells her in no uncertain terms to go away, quit stalking her, etc.; Kay Lin reaches out, and when she makes contact Joce jabs back, knocking her over. Joce freezes; Caleb's watching in the window. Panicked, she runs.

As Joce tries in vain to convince herself this was inevitable, even that this was right and necessary, the haze is thicker than ever. She thinks she's being followed. Caleb sets off blasts on the trail behind them, and threatens to sic people and/or rabbits on her unless Joce apologizes—not even for Kay Lin, but for Addison. Joce refuses; at Caleb's prompting (he's noticed the rabbits don't seem to care for him; he muses they like *tougher* prey), rabbits close in.

Between the blasts, echoing cry-wailing, haze, and her own sprain acting up, Joce is cornered. Caleb offers her one last chance to defend herself, then says he wouldn't buy it anyway. As he's about to stab her with a broken bottle, he gets thwacked and grabbed from behind; Kay Lin stabs and slices his throat. (This breaks the pendant chain; pieces scatter and fall to the ground.) Caleb drops, chokes, and lies still.

As he starts melting away (clothes and blood and all), Kay Lin (who seems rather red, or is it the lighting?) leans in close, blank-faced. She turns the glass towards her own neck, saying exactly how long it takes for someone to asphyxiate and bleed out. Joce can't move.

## 5
The first part is shown through the framing device of what seems to be a first-person video game. This is how Joce approaches the third challenge, a silent capture-the-flag in which opposing players are eliminated/"tagged" via jab to the neck. (It doesn't kill; they're all wearing something that both detects the hit and indicates team.) Joce is laser-focused—except when that damn sprain makes itself known again.

Interspersing the silent montage are (achronological?) snippets of what happened between last part and now: the challenge summons went off, and only then did Kay Lin back up. She acted vaguely normal, complaining of a headache, but Joce walked past her in a trance. Rabbits loom but don't attack; this mirrors people lurking in the challenge just out of sight. Joce couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. At the Beacon, Joce overheard an exchange between Gary and the accountant suggesting the accountant had been out the previous night. (The entire house segment took all night.) Despite serious hangovers, no one seems to have been poisoned.

Partway through the challenge, Kay Lin seems to tower over Joce again—Joce shoves past, and it's the lookalike. As Joce nears the goal, she recognizes Gary about to ambush the *actual* Kay Lin; despite instinct, Joce ignores this and smashes the target, claiming victory.

The winning team's prizes: messages in bottles, letters from home. Joce pointedly ignores hers and starts to leave solo, adrenaline (and energy) fading fast. Gary approaches with congratulations and invites her to return to the house; Joce, drained, accuses him of setting a trap, since three people left last night and only two came back; Gary is confused, apparently unaware, but says he's offering on good faith anyway. Long as she follows the house rule (no drama, no murder, all that), it's fine with him. Lurking rabbits, the ongoing feeling of being watched, and incoming exhaustion convince Joce to concede. The second she reaches the house, she finds the nearest bed and crashes.

When Joce wakes up, her prize bottle's nearby, along with a note from the accountant; "Someone's looking out for you ;)," plus a request to meet her in her study. Joce leaves the bottle and decides to actually talk to people,both to get a sense of what happened and maybe make new allies.

Two things quickly become apparent: first, Kay Lin is here (though she doesn't keep eye contact with Joce or vice versa; she talks halfheartedly to others, head down), and second, Joce's attempts at outreach are a self-fulfilling prophecy. While there are a few raised eyebrows (why *was* Kay Lin asking about her last night? Why's she acting funny now?), Joce mostly digs her own grave by not knowing how to approach people → noticing people are giving her weird looks → getting frustrated and agitated, which makes her act more obviously erratic and *definitely* puts people off.

After a couple rounds of this, Joce returns to the common area and sees Gary talking to Kay Lin. The latter is bruised where Joce hit her last night, and Gary looks sympathetic. Joce internally flips. At the first opportunity she tries to pull Gary aside; she confesses without prompting that she lashed out last night, but for wholly unrelated reasons, she thinks something's up with Kay Lin. She doesn't get further when she notices people eavesdropping, and walks off on the spot.

At this point Joce needs a fuckin' drink; she picks the next best thing and finds the accountant in the now-unlocked study. The accountant has recreated a map of the place, with new paths and chasms marked and several details shifted. She'd like Joce's input. Joce explains her own theory about the map looping, as if the entire game takes place on some warped sphere; this delights the accountant, who calls Joce a genius. Despite everything, Joce feels kinda good about that.

Gary steps in, apparently about to ask to talk about something, but freezes when he sees Joce. The accountant looks between them and (still delighted) connects the dots quickly: this is about that girl, isn't it? Of *course* she noticed both last night's outing and Caleb's subsequent absence, not to mention Joce and Kay Lin being noticeably separate. The accountant has also determined that Joce wouldn't intentionally kill a flea. Joce tries to interject ("Don't hurt her"); Gary attempts to assure her this only means Kay Lin would get kicked out, though the accountant thinks they ought to revisit that idea. Apologetic, Gary tells Joce to wait outside; she doesn't need to be asked twice.

People are interrogating Kay Lin as if she's been abused; she denies it, but is mostly talked over. Joce, ignoring everyone else, tries to grab her and leave, asap; Kay Lin is baffled, and it exacerbates people's bad impressions. Gary interrupts, calling both Joce and Kay Lin aside.

He takes them out the back, admitting he personally doesn't care *what* they do as long as they don't threaten each other or anyone here, but the accountant thinks otherwise. Between that and the other guests' suspicion, he tries to usher them out quietly. (Joce's unprompted confession has convinced him she's one of the "good guys," and he finds it hard to believe Kay Lin is dangerous.) On the way out, Kay Lin asks for Joce's bottle-prize; the accountant, having watched this whole scene, hands it over with a grin. Safe travels, you two~!

## 6
Tensions have not abated. The landscape's more perilous now than it was at the start, with new chasms tearing through the surface and the remnants of broken structures sharp and abundant.

Joce has confessed to selling Kay Lin out. She insists, however, that she dragged Kay Lin out to save her, because she cares, and that's a confession. Kay Lin, however, accuses her of having a savior complex, dragging Kay Lin along without Kay Lin's input to make herself feel better; Joce asks what the hell last night (the Caleb kill) was about. Kay Lin hesitates; Joce presses, and eventually Kay Lin says she was trying to see if Joce would fight back. It would've been so *easy* for her to throw either of them off. (J: "Did you *want* to get stabbed?" KL: "Yes. *No!*")

Less argue-y: Kay Lin doesn't understand why Joce has continued looking out for her—a sentiment Joce can relate to, for better *and* for worse. Their talking has attracted a couple of rabbits; building on old plans (while being chased), Joce and Kay Lin lure the creatures to a vulnerable spot, then pull the figurative trigger just in time. Concluding both that and the "why do you care about me so much" conversation (which is not quite answered on either end, but there's weird comfort in knowing it's mutual) Kay Lin offers a reconciliatory handshake: "Here's to being fucked up." Joce would prefer not to be, but takes it anyway.

She takes pity on the people who become rabbits. Kay Lin doesn't have much to say about it.

As darkness falls again (Joce woke up around midday; the day went by fast, yes), they find a small area of the underground that's rabbit-free (implicitly, the rabbits they just killed used to dwell here), and take shelter. Joce is still carrying the bottle, and when Kay Lin falls asleep, she decides to get rid of it. She treks deeper to an underground pool, where she deliberates how to destroy it forever—or if she even wants to.

Gary approaches. Implicitly he's been frustrated with the accountant all day and found her underground route; he also wants to check in with Joce and Kay Lin. Joce warily lets him approach, and inevitably he asks about the letter; she says it's from someone she doesn't care for, but she can't bring herself to get rid of it. She's certain it'll be a bunch of whining, anyway. Gary suggests she read it just for peace of mind, and since he doesn't pry further, Joce decides to give it a go.

She expects a sob story from Sal, some pathetic begging for her to take them back. Instead she gets a righteous declaration of eternally-soured intent, in which Sal blames her for abandoning them more callously than anyone ever has, not ever truly caring about them, and in sum this is a suicide note and they want to die knowing she's well aware of just how much she's ruined them.

Joce is *incensed*. While she was focused on reading, more rabbits were closing in; Gary snaps her out of it and they try to fight back together, Gary with his bat and Joce with the bottle. Although this almost works, with Gary bashing one right into the pool (where it seems to start melting alive), it threatens to drag him down with. At Gary's frantic suggestion, Joce triggers a small collapse to hit it in time, but the concentrated cave-in buries him with.

Kay Lin, woken by the ruckus, finds Joce standing knee-deep among the wreckage. After making sure the coast is clear, she wades in; Joce doesn't respond. Wordlessly she takes Joce's hand. There's blood in the water.
