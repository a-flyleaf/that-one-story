Part divisions are subject to change, especially around the middle, but for the sake of scope I would really like to not break 12. That said, lengths vary.

After a couple rewrites of varying lengths and amounts of expressiveness, I've settled on what I hope is a happy medium: about a sentence a scene, with additional notes at the end of each part for visually- and/or thematically-significant details. \[also I challenged myself to write each part in half and hour because HOO FUCKIN BOY did it get out of hand otherwise]

## 1
tentative title: "Relapse"

Players wake up in a panopticon-esque underground and are introduced to the game: many have entered, one will win, and the winner can go home. Have fun!

Protagonist Joce lives a predictable, bare-minimum lifestyle, which quickly becomes stifling when quarantine hits. She's also sustained a minor ankle sprain; inspired by videos of parkour, she took a route she shouldn't have. When she returns to her room, two housemates (apparently a couple, one more thoughtful than the other) are in her room. They give her a couple letters: a letter from "Skoal," which is quickly shoved in a drawer full of unopened letters from the same sender, and a flyer inviting her to the thrill of her dreams. Joce thinks it's a scam, but can't stand the monotony. She glances up at the one sign of personality in her room: above her bed, a worn poster of a gritty action hero.

Back in-game, one player has started rallying the others; when she calls on Joce, Joce ignores it. However, when the grandstander picks on a small girl curled up in a corner (who also doesn't respond, to the speaker's frustration), Joce takes notice.

One player has found food. Joce stands over them, intimidating.

Joce places the morsel by the girl, then stands back, thinking about how the world is unfair, every person for themselves—but the strong are morally obliged to look after the less fortunate. The girl interrupts the internal monologue to ask what Joce is staring at. Joce, immediately taken off-guard, claims she was standing guard, which the girl doesn't buy because no one was paying attention. She offers the scrap to Joce; when Joce turns it down, the girl mentions it only takes days to starve, less without water. Joce thinks she's a little young to know that; the girl claims she went to med school, or was going to. She introduces herself as "Kay Lin" (two-word first name) and offers a handshake; Joce, clearly not used to this, returns it.

Meanwhile, someone in the crowd suggests that no one has to die. The underground abruptly starts flooding; with an earthquake and an ear-splitting alarm, the first challenge starts: escape. Joce grabs Kay Lin and runs for the more difficult but straightforward path. As players scramble to ascend, Joce thinks she's got this; then someone (necklace-wearing, the only detail Joce notices) falls to their apparent death below, and then Joce freezes. Kay Lin stops, u-turns, and reaches out; although this invokes a penalty, the two make it out by working together. (In the background, there's an exchange along the lines of "Come on, Terry!" "Who?" "Gary!")

When players reach the surface, they're rewarded by supplies and weapons (a baseball bat)—except for Joce and Kay Lin, who as per penalty get jack shit. Joce leaves, Kay Lin follows; the camera lingers on a white-rotted hand rising from below.

Trekking through the hazy, barren landscape, Joce insists there is no "we," and since she doesn't answer Kay Lin's questions about her own motives, Kay Lin won't answer hers. She also insists she doesn't need shelter. Their banter is interrupted by what sounds like someone crying, a strangled wail; Joce approaches despite Kay Lin's hesitation. The noise comes from a crevice underground; when Joce speaks, a humanoid rabbit-monster bursts out and lunges at her. Joce is absolutely no match and is quickly chased down. For a split second, she thinks she sees a human face in its mouth; the rabbit clamps down, and she blacks out.

A "game over" screen flashes, along with two options: continue, quit. Though frazzled, Joce refuses to entertain the idea of leaving when Kay Lin is still in there, and slams continue; it produces a small drink.

Joce finds the rabbit dead, semi-melted into the ground. It was being choked by the same necklace as the first to fall, and has been blasted by some ambiguous warm liquid. Kay Lin's on standby, apparently having triggered the blast by using rubble to smash a nearby rock formation. Joce demands to know how she knew; Kay Lin admits she's familiar with this place, but doesn't know why she's here. (J: "Like an NPC." KL: "What? No—" J: "I'm joking. Partially.") Joce relents, and they leave to find shelter.

Meanwhile, the grandstander, Addison, has kept a small group around, including a small boy Caleb who she lent a hand and now refuses to leave her side. (Minor detail: Addison's outfit has changed, and now includes an eight-pointed star pendant.) The group is approached by a rabbit-figure, apparently the owner of the white-rotted hand; mostly human, sans skull-mask. "White Rabbit" (WR) doesn't talk, but indicates they want to join the group; when Addison hesitates, WR takes her bat and smashes a nearby structure, blasting a hellrabbit no one noticed was there. Addison relents. ("...Sold. Welcome aboard.")

Joce and Kay Lin have taken refuge somewhere high-up, which feels exposed but allows decent lookout. As Kay Lin sleeps, Joce realizes she can't leave her behind: for one thing, Kay Lin is either an invaluable ally or a too-knowledgeable enemy. But on a base level, Joce still feels the need to keep her safe. (Joce has also sustained a small ring of white-rot around one finger since the game over. She can't tell if there's any on Kay Lin.) Despite all this, if there can only be one winner, Joce is sure they're doomed. For now, best not to think about it.

## 2
Night at the alliance base. Another tall person in a(n obviously-fake) mask, "Wolf," is trying to ask Addison about logistics. Meanwhile, WR is helping allies set up camp. Addison pulls WR aside.

Out of earshot, Addison admits she has no idea what she's doing, but doesn't expect the alliance to last anyway. However, she wants WR to be a "true" ally; she "reminds" WR that, had she not spoken up, WR would have been attacked on sight. For now, people are still listening to her. "And *you*... you know how to pitch a tent." Addison offers a handshake to seal the deal.

Joce wakes up and is annoyed to find this was not in fact some giant nightmare. She resumes her trek from yesterday; back at base (marked by the Beacon, the tallest structure around; it resembles the red north arrow of a compass), there was a map, and Joce wants to see just how far this land extends. She also has Kay Lin tell her more about the rabbits and this place; supposedly, rabbits are attracted to noise, but if blasted by whatever's in these rocks (which is triggered by any sort of breakage; some structures are easier to crack than others), they melt. They brainstorm techniques for dispatching any further rabbits without weaponry; Joce does most of the talking, and is mildly disappointed by the peaceful journey.

Meanwhile, Addison has gathered a small crew (WR, Wolf, a third "guard," and Caleb insisted on tagging along) to return to the Beacon for supplies and "further planning." (She seems to be bluffing, to avoid dealing with minituitae at camp.) Joce and Kay Lin enter, Joce baffled; Addison has the crew approach & subtly corner them.

Addison offers a reintroduction and offers a handshake; Joce ignores it and gives her a fake name. Addison suggests Joce join the group for her own good; Joce points out that Addison has been ignoring Kay Lin, and though Addison tries to half-ass an extended invite, Caleb interjects to call Joce rude (and Kay Lin a creep, for just standing there staring at her). Wolf tries to shut him up; there's wailing outside. Joce has moved to higher ground to get a better look; however, Addison follows, and tries to repeat her "true alliance" offer. Joce insults her, saying she's not interested in being another shoulder accessory/bodyguard, and that Addison is everything wrong with people today: using others as means, ego fuel, and ignoring the rest.

While they're talking at each other, rabbits enter the scene. Caleb and Kay Lin are shoved in a semi-underground space for safety, while the guard trio try to fight back. Despite each person being individually strong, they're barely coordinated; WR on defense, Wolf on offense, and third trying to help whoever's closest. At one point they rely on Wolf as backup; Wolf fails to provide, and the third is chomped by a rabbit.

Joce has started trying to escape; Addison stopped following after the insults, but in the wake of the third's demise (their body goes still, then starts melting into the ground), a rabbit gets close to Addison. Joce dispatches it/pulls her away, then gets down for good; she grabs Kay Lin (offers Caleb an opening too, which he doesn't take) and makes a run for it.

As Joce and Kay Lin leave, Joce asks why Kay Lin didn't tell her about the landscape looping. Kay Lin points out that Joce wasn't listening much earlier anyway; after some protest, Joce dryly apologizes, with something to the effect of "I'll heed your every word from now on, my liege." Finally answering, Kay Lin shrugs; she claims she just never noticed.

Back at the alliance, Addison is still agitated. Wolf has nothing kind to say about her; Caleb's the only one claiming defense, and he's annoying everyone about it including Addison. She tries making a speech clarifying and apologizing for the situation, but it sounds phony and makes matters worse.

That night, Addison returns to the Beacon solo, and finds that the underground is no longer flooded. She hears someone following, assumes it's WR, and rant-monologues; it's unclear whether she's more upset about the death, her own incompetence, or Joce pointing it out. In conclusion, she's down here because she's hoping to find something that can control this place so everyone will love her again—and, more genuinely, so she can be someone worth saving.

Caleb thinks she already is. After the initial "oh my god you did NOT hear all that" and "dude stop stalking me," Caleb claims he wants her to come back; Addison insists she's got to make this trip worthwhile first, and so down they go. They manage a calmer talk about motives; Caleb's here because he's been bullied his whole life and wants to get stronger, and Addison's just a politician's daughter and wanted to make some kind of name for herself. Implicitly that parent is out a lot; Caleb promises *he'd* never leave, which is not super comforting.

Even deeper down, they find some kind of intricate mechanism, which Caleb notices Addison's pendant could unlock. At this point Addison is ready to turn around, but Caleb insists she try it. She relents, which triggers a cave-in/flood. Caleb grabs the pendant but it's no use. While escaping, they reach a crossroads; Caleb is frozen, and when Addison tries to push him one way, he flees down the other. Then the space collapses.

Cut to the ground shaking above; another siren-summons beckons players to the Beacon for the second challenge. Joce notices Caleb alone and more distraught than usual. (Minor detail, won't be noticeable until next part: Caleb's wearing the pendant now.) As the instructions begin, Caleb has an outburst: Addison is dead. Joce takes pity on him; Kay Lin, among a majority of players, find this annoying as hell. Let the games begin!
