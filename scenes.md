Part divisions are subject to change, especially around the middle, but for the sake of scope I would really like to not break 12. That said, lengths vary.

## 1
possible title: "Relapse"

### rise and shine
- Cold open: Players wake up in a panopticon-esque underground, and are welcomed to the game. Many have entered, one will win, and the winner can go home. Joce knows she's made a mistake.
- Flashback: Joce lives a rote life in one room of a shared house. Thanks to a mild sprain that won't go away and forced isolation via quarantine, old (unhealthy) temptations are resurfacing.  
Her housemates deliver two letters: one from "Skoal," which is shoved in a drawer full of unopened letters from the same sender, and an invitation to the thrill of a lifetime.
	- The one sign of personality in Joce's otherwise-bare-minimum room is a poster on the wall featuring a gritty action movie hero.
- Back in the underground spiral, one player rallies a group, and calls on the outliers including Joce; Joce pointedly ignores her. Then the grandstander turns to a small person curled in a corner, who doesn't even look up; Joce takes notice.
- Someone found food. Joce stands over them, intimidating.
- Joce places the morsel next to the small girl, then leans back, thinking about how the strong must protect the weak. The girl interrupts: "What are you doing?"  
Banter and introductions: the girl's name is *Kay Lin*; went to medical school, or was going to. \[Replace this with mspaint comic?] Joce hesitantly accepts Kay Lin's introductory handshake and offers her own name.
- From the crowd: "No one has to die, right?" The underground abruptly floods; Joce grabs Kay Lin and runs. First challenge: escape. Only way out is up. Joce thinks she's got this.
- Someone (wearing a necklace) falls to their apparent death; Joce realizes she does not got this. Kay Lin u-turns to lend a hand. This incurs a penalty, but together Joce and Kay Lin help each other up and out.
	- Background exchange: "Come on, Terry!" "Huh?" "Gary!"
- Survivors gather supplies, including baseball bats. The penalty: Joce and Kay Lin get jack shit. Joce leaves, Kay Lin tags along. Camera lingers on a hand, rotting white, bursting from a crack.

### sweet nightmares
- Overall setting: a barren, hazy hellscape, pierced by rock formations and carved by stagnant streams of thick fluid. Players disperse from the Beacon, a huge structure resembling the red North arrow of a compass.  
Joce intends to trek the landscape alone; Kay Lin insists on following. Since Joce won't explain what brought her here, neither will Kay Lin. Kay Lin thinks they should find shelter; Joce thinks she doesn't need it. A distorted scream/cry rings out from not far away, which Joce approaches despite Kay Lin's hesitance.
- The cry echoes from a crevice. When Joce calls out, enter hellrabbit: a wide-eyed, frenzied humanoid that tries to grab and decapitate Joce. For a spilt second she thinks she sees a face; then it clamps down. Blackout.
- Flickering "game over." Two options: give up, persist. Joce can't abandon Kay Lin; she hits the latter. It produces a small drink.
- Joce wakes up. The rabbit lies melting, seeping through the ground. It's wearing (was strangled by) the same necklace as the first person to fall.
- The rabbit was blasted by a sideways spew from a nearby rock formation; Kay Lin's nearby. Joce demands to know how she knew; Kay Lin admits she's familiar with this place, but isn't sure what she's doing here. Dramatic pause. Joce: "Like an NPC." KL: "—What? No, wh--" "I'm kidding. Partially." Then: "Let's find shelter."
- Night falls. Higher up feels exposed, but there's no sign of rabbits. Joce decides to keep Kay Lin around; her familiarity makes her simultaneously a vaulable ally and a dangerous enemy. And on a base level, Joce still wants to keep her safe—even though, if the game is whittling the competition down to one, it can't last.
- Minor, tiny detail: ever since the "game over," there's been a ring of white-rot around one of Joce's fingers. Kay Lin has nothing of the sort (visible, at least).

### (post-credits?) who are you
- Back at the Beacon base, the grandstander, Addison, has kept a sizable group around. (A timid boy she helped during the challenge, Caleb, stays especially close.) Someone screams; a "rabbit" approaches—hands up? It's the figure with white-rot, mostly human except for a rabbit skull-mask. The figure (henceforth dubbed White Rabbit/WR) doesn't talk, but indicates she wants to join the group. Addison is hesitant; WR grabs Addison's bat and smashes a nearby structure, blasting a rabbit no one noticed was lurking.  
Stunned silence. All eyes swivel back to WR. Addison: ". . . Sold. Welcome aboard."
	- \[Replace with ref comparison?] Addison has made a couple cosmetic additions to her outfit: cool jacket, combat boots, and an eight-pointed star pendant necklace that doesn't quite match. (Not the same as the fallen's neckwear.)

### \[opening]
- First night, alliance base. Someone with a costume-skull mask, "Wolf," is trying to talk logistics to Addison and she's not really having it. Meanwhile, WR helps allies set up camp, much to their adoration. Addison pulls WR aside.
- Once they're out of earshot, Addison confesses: "I have *no idea* what I'm doing." After a brief rant about how the alliance is doomed anyway, she suggests she and WR be "true" allies. "Don't forget, if I hadn't been there, those people would've attacked you on sight. But for now, everyone's still listening to me. And you... *you* know how to pitch a tent." She offers a handshake to seal the deal.

### \[???]
- *What a nightmare.* Joce wakes up. She's still here. "Son of a—..."
	- KL: "Good mornin' to you, too, sunshine."
- Joce's mission of the day: get as far away from the Beacon as humanly possible. On the way, she and Kay Lin talk rabbit-dispatching; supposedly, they stay underground, are attracted to noise, and hate water (well, "water;" whatever's in these stones). Some structures break more easily than others; all spew on breakage. Although Joce brainstorms techniques, no rabbits show up, which is weirdly disappointing.
	- The talk is 90% Joce thinking out loud. She may or may not dismiss Kay Lin's suggestions outright, but they're not strongly-considered.
- Addison and a small party (WR, Wolf, a third "guard," and Caleb as a tagalong) have returned to the Beacon base to check for more supplies (there are none, though no one (J+KL included) seems to be hungry) and generally plan. Meanwhile, Joce and Kay Lin return, much to Joce's confusion; Addison recognizes Joce immediately, and the party subtly corners J+KL by a central map.
- Addison reintroduces herself, complete with a handshake offer; Joce is not interested, and gives her a fake name. (Addison gets it wrong anyway.) Still, Addison insists on inviting her to join the group, for her own good; Joce interrupts to point out she's completely ignoring Kay Lin. Addison half-asses an invitation; Caleb butts in to yell at Joce for being rude.
	- Kay Lin keeps to the background here, yes. Missable detail: <span class="spoiler">She's staring at Addison's pendant.</span> (Although this could be mistaken for something else.)
- As Caleb rants, resisting the guard trio's efforts to shut him up, Addison tries to pull Joce aside. Then rabbits descend upon the scene. Joce and Addison are separated from the others; the trio shoves Caleb and Kay Lin somewhere off to the side for safety. Addison tries to speedrun her alliance offer to Joce; Joce berates her for treating everyone else like an accessory to her own ego, and rejects the idea of becoming another goddamn bodyguard. Joce is trying to get down the entire time; Addison stays close to her, up until the insults. But when a rabbit targets her, Joce blasts it back.  
Meanwhile, the "guards" are individually strong but uncoordinated, especially Wolf (who's on self-defense only). At one point WR breaks rank to defend the little guys; this gets the third killed. The rabbit clamps down, there's a horrible pause, and the third slumps.  
It's enough distraction for Joce to grab Kay Lin (she offers Caleb an opening, but he doesn't take it and she's not waiting) and get the hell out of dodge.

### \[???]
There are two split follow-ups here, not sure which is shown first.

- Joce, frazzled as hell, asks Kay Lin why she didn't tell Joce about the landscape looping. Kay Lin asks why Joce gave Addison a fake name. J: "Was she listening?" Back to Kay Lin. But Kay Lin asks if *Joce* was listening, earlier. Joce is frustrated but makes herself pause; she says something about heeding Kay Lin's every word from now on. Kay Lin is silent. Finally Joce apologizes, and with a shrug, Kay Lin admits she never noticed \[that the "edges" of the world lead back to the "opposite" side].

- Addison is perturbed. Wolf is blaming her for the third's death; Caleb is the only one countering, but he's... *Caleb.* Addison tries to make a speech explaining and apologizing for the events, but it sounds phony and makes matters worse.

- As night falls, Addison ventures back to the Beacon, this time underground, solo. (It's drained since the intro; during the earlier incident, this became noticeable.) She thinks she hears someone following, assumes it's WR, and rambles; it's ambiguous whether she's more upset by the third's death or her own incompetence or Joce *pointing out* her incompetence. Either way, she's looking for something that will make things right. Maybe the Beacon's controls? Then everyone will love her again—and, more genuinely, she can be someone worth saving.
- Caleb thinks she already is, and Addison backpedals *furiously*. But past the initial "oh my god you did NOT just hear all that" and "wtf stop stalking me" ":( but you should come back," they manage to have a calmer talk. Caleb is (excessively) grateful because he's been bullied his whole life, came here to get stronger, and he knows Addison doesn't like him much but he feels indebted anyway. Addison doesn't have a sob story; her dad's a politician and out of the house a lot, big whoop. Caleb promises he'd *never* leave her, though. (Addison is not super comforted.)
- As they talk they go further down; after ^that from Caleb, they find what seems to be some type of lock. At this point Addison is actually ready to turn back, but Caleb suggests she might as well do something while they're down here. He recognizes the pendant fits the slot and insists Addison try it. She relents—and triggers an earthquake.
- Caleb grabs the pendant but it does nothing; the cavern's already started flooding. While trying to escape, he and Addison reach a crossroads; Addison is convinced it's one way, but Caleb is frozen. At the last second he bolts down the other path, leaving Addison as the whole space floods.
- Ear-splitting alarm, minor earthquake. Same signal as the first; players are summoned to the second challenge.

- As everyone takes their designated positions, Joce notices Caleb is alone and more distraught than usual. (It's not noticeable yet, but he's wearing the pendant from this point on.) The challenge instructions begin—but Caleb has an outburst: Addison is dead.
