a sentence a scene keeps the text wall awayeah it really doesn't but I can try

Part divisions are subject to change, especially around the middle, but for the sake of scope I would really like to not break 12. That said, lengths vary.

## 1
- tentative title: "Relapse"

Players wake in a panopticon-esque underground, and are welcomed to the game: many have entered, one will win, and the winner can go home.

Joce lives a mundane, predictable life in one room of a shared house, and has incessant intrusive thoughts of imminent disaster. (It's usually background noise.) But thanks to both a mild sprain that refuses to wear off and quarantine driving everyone battier than usual, the predictability feels stifling. In this context Joce receives two letters: one from "Salvador," which is shoved in a drawer full of unopened letters from the same sender, and an invitation to the thrill of a lifetime.

Back in the underground, one player has taken it upon herself to rally the others; Joce isn't interested. When the grandstander picks out someone much smaller, however, Joce takes notice. She approaches the nearest person with food, intimidates them, and offers the morsel to the girl in the corner.

Joce "stands guard," internally monologues/zones out about the world being harsh and the strong needing to look after the less fortunate, and then the girl asks what Joce is doing. Thus introduces Kay Lin, who is neither a child (claims she went to medical school, or was going to) nor withdrawn as Joce anticipated. Joce introduces herself by name without thinking and immediately regrets it.

The talk is interrupted by the underground flooding, which spurs the first challenge: escape, and the only way out is up—and crowding fast. Joce has a good grip until the first person falls, at which point she starts internally panicking. Kay Lin U-turns to reach out, after which they help each other up to the end.

Unfortunately Kay Lin's act incurred a penalty: while the other survivors gather supplies and weapons (baseball bats), Joce and Kay Lin get jack shit. Joce decides not to stick around; the "camera" lingers on a hand, rotted white, rising from the deep.

That central zone was below the Beacon, a huge structure resembling the red North arrow of a compass. Joce intends to trek to the boundaries of the landscape alone, but Kay Lin stays close. Their banter is interrupted by what sounds like someone screaming and/or crying, which Joce investigates despite Kay Lin's hesitance.

The wailing echoes out from a crevice; it's a rabbit, which attacks Joce on sight and swiftly overpowers her. Joce is faced with a "game over" screen, with two options: give up, continue. Though rattled, she doesn't want to abandon Kay Lin, and hits the latter option. It procures a small drink.

Joce wakes to find the rabbit has been dispatched and is half-melted through the ground; when she tries to lift the jaw for a closer look, it drips molten through her fingers. Upon seeing Kay Lin did this (blasting the rabbit with that ambiguous fluid, which is apparently *in* the rocks), Joce asks how she knew; Kay Lin admits she's too familiar with this place, but isn't sure why she's here.

As the sky darkens, Joce decides to keep Kay Lin around; that familiarity makes her simultaneously a valuable ally and a dangerous enemy. And on the basest level, Joce still feels the need to keep her safe—even though, if the game is whittling down the competition down to one, it can't last. Is she being played for a fool? If it means sticking to her guns, does she care?

### also of note
- There's a poster above Joce's bed of a gritty action hero, which she looks up at before the flashback cuts back to present. It is the one (1) sign of personality in an otherwise utilitarian room.
- Joce and Kay Lin's introduction is pronounced with a handshake. I basically have this whole conversation committed to memory—hence why, ironically, it's kinda skimmed over here.
- In the background of the challenge, there's an exchange like "Come on, Terry!" "Who?" "Gary!"
- The first person to fall is distinguished by some kind of necklace. The same accessory is strangling the rabbit.
- At a later point, Joce asks what Kay Lin is doing here. Kay Lin returns the question. Joce says it's not important. Same answer from Kay Lin, then. Oh yeah, mutual progress.
- Minor detail: after Joce wakes up from the "game over," she has a small ring of white-rot around the base of one finger. But since she wears gloves (and has all sorts of miscellaneous hand scratches), it's barely noticeable.
- Full disclaimer, I do not know how the little guys trigger the rock-blast-thing yet. But they do. They have their ways.

### post-credits? bonus? start of next installment??
Back at the Beacon base, the grandstander, Addison, has kept a sizable group around. (A timid boy she helped during the challenge, Caleb, stays especially close.) The figure that rotted hand belonged to, henceforth dubbed "White Rabbit" (WR; she *is* mostly human, though), approaches; WR doesn't talk, but indicates she wants to join the group. When Addison hesitates, WR takes a bat and smashes down a nearby structure, blasting a rabbit no one noticed was there.

No one's protesting after that.

- From the supply-gathering on, Addison has a slightly different outfit. It includes a necklace with an eight-pointed star pendant, which doesn't seem to be part of the usual handouts.

## 2
Over the first night, WR helped allies set up camp. Addison pulled her aside and, admitting to little faith in her own leadership or the alliance's longevity, proposed a "true" alliance.

The next day, Joce sets out on a straight path away from the Beacon, continuing her trek; she and Kay Lin troubleshoot a means of rabbit-blasting, but the journey is thankfully quiet.

Meanwhile, Addison struggles to keep up with everything going on with everyone, which is obviously something she must do; she gets fed up, rounds up three of the tough guys (WR included), and decides to scope out the land, grab more supplies. (Caleb insists on joining, too.)

Back at the Beacon, Addison's party finds Joce and Kay Lin puzzling over a map. Addison reintroduces herself, clearly interested in getting Joce on her side, but again Joce is unimpressed. Rabbits are spotted outside, which splits Addison and Joce from the group; Addison tries to propose similar to Joce as she did to WR, but Joce tells her off. Joce escapes with Kay Lin and one of Addison's "guards" is killed in the fray.

Returning to the alliance, the non-WR surviving guard, "Wolf," churns a rumor mill around Addison's incompetence, while only Caleb tries defending her. Addison tries an explanation/apology talk of dubious genuity, which mostly makes things worse.

That night Addison ventures underground, seemingly in hopes of finding something big or important that will make everyone love her again. (Probably following up on something she noticed back during the Beacon attack?) Caleb follows her down, and though they have a nice talk at first, Caleb insists on bringing her back. Frustrated, Addison sets something off (inadvertently? intentionally? intentionally, but worse than anticipated?), and the space collapses.

The Beacon summons players back with an ear-splitting alarm and a minor earthquake. Joce notices Caleb is alone; when the instructions begin, he cries louder, announcing that Addison is dead.

### also of note
- Addison concludes both her alliance offer to WR and her own reintroduction to Joce with a handshake; in the latter case, she prompts Joce's own name. The WR scene cuts after this, and Joce refuses the offer on both accounts.
- Joce is confused by the map because she walked away in a straight line and found the Beacon right back in front of her. This will be talked about explicitly later.
- Joce has thought Addison is full of shit from day one, but here she calls Addison on both talking as though Kay Lin isn't standing right there and, later, abandoning her crew to fight for themselves. This definitely gets under Addison's skin, though it remains unclear how much of her later upset is from Joce's words vs the reputational hit.
- Maaaybe instead of randomly finding the pendant earlier, it's down here, and moving it is what sets things off? Idk. This part's still a lil fuzzy, but there *are* some kind of controls down here.
- Kay Lin takes a background role in this installment, but is among the majority who finds Caleb's outburst at the end more annoying than sympatheitc.

## 3
Thanks to Caleb it takes some fumbling for everyone to get the hang of what they're supposed to be doing, but for summary's sake: In the second challegne, players are divided into smaller groups of ~5, one of whom is a designated outlier. Going solely based on talk and one clue, non-outliers have to determine and vote out the oddity; the oddity simply has to be the last of two standing. The winner(s) advance to the next physical level for a prize at the peak; losers don't have to die this time.

Game one, round one: Joce and Kay Lin are grouped with Caleb, Wolf, and a fifth. Caleb accuses Joce of basically-murder for throwing Addison off yesterday; Kay Lin points out that's irrelevant to the challenge, turns the ever-aggressive Wolf on him, and thus Caleb is unanimously voted out. (Not the outlier.)  
Round two: Joce is called out for not saying much, tries to question Wolf, and regrets it immediately; Kay Lin interjects and swings the spotlight over to the fifth, who tries to defend but slips up. They're the outlier, game over.

Between challenge-games, Kay Lin asks Joce why Joce didn't scapegoat her. Joce can't answer before the next round begins.

Game two: Joce is grouped with the person who was teaming up with Gary during the challenge. (This person hasn't given a name yet, but for summary's sake I'll prematurely use what she *will* call herself: "the accountant.") They inadvertently team up, Joce following the accountant's lead, as they're both innocent and the accountant has a very sharp memory. Despite the easy victory, Joce is unsettled.

Game three: Joce is the outlier. She quickly determines she cannot lie for shit and folds.

Lingering at base, Caleb is still trying to convince people Joce is evil incarnate. Gary steps up to invite anyone who wants a break from the drama to join him at his place; only house rule is *no murder*. Unwilling to face the alliance's scrutiny, Joce joins them (and Kay Lin, as always, tags along).

At the house, Joce encourages Kay Lin to go socialize/see if anyone's on to them, while Joce investigates the place solo. Much of it is eerily empty, but at one point she gets overambitious, falls, and reaggravates the sprain. Kay Lin finds her, reports that no one cares, and tries to get close, spiking Joce's paranoia. The accountant interrupts to announce drinks are being served, with the unspoken implication attendance is mandatory.

### also of note
- Caleb is wearing Addison's necklace now.
- The fifth person in the first challenge-game, referred to in the cast as "[nameless]({%include url.html%}/cast#nameless)," looks vaguely similar to Kay Lin. Background people aren't generally visually defined, so the similarity could just come down to having long straight hair or something. They're not related. But it's intentional.
- There's probably some kind of character dynamic echo in the others from the second game, too. Haven't defined that yet.
- Yeah, I need to figure out the house layout and exactly what Joce gets tripped up by here.
- Did I mention this part hasn't been super fleshed-out yet?

## 4
At a table in the corner, Joce and Kay Lin are joined by Caleb, who offers a self-pitying apology to Joce and claims he was kicked out (or walked out, it's unclear) of the alliance now that Wolf's in charge. Caleb then tries to make small talk, which increasingly irritates Kay Lin; when he teases her directly, she has an outburst and spills her drink on Joce. Joce gets up and leaves.

The air reeks of other peoples' giddy stupors, and Joce starts drowning in a slurry of uncomfortable intimacy and overflowing bottles. Even outside is hazier than usual; Kay Lin finds Joce pacing, agitated. Joce tells Kay Lin to go away but Kay Lin keeps trying to reach out; when Kay Lin makes physical contact Joce jerks back on instinct, knocking her over. Joce notices Caleb watching from the window, panics, and flees the scene.

Joce tries to tell herself separation was inevitable and she's cutting her losses; she gets lost in the smog fast. Someone sets off blasts nearby, chasing her down. Caleb corners Joce and demands an apology, not for Kay Lin but for Addison, and then *maybe* he'll defend her when everyone else finds out; Joce refuses.

Caleb is about to stab her when *he* gets jabbed in the neck instead. Kay Lin stands behind him as his body falls, spasms, and melts through the cracks in the ground; she then gets uncomfortably close to Joce, gesturing to her own neck and saying how quickly a neck wound can kill. Joce can't move.

### also of note
- At the table as they sit down, Joce tells Kay Lin not to take a sip. Kay Lin agrees, as drinking "makes \[her] all red and fucked-up." It's implied she took a swig between getting shoved and when she appears again at the end of the installment.
- The outburst bit is like: Kay Lin makes a snarky comment → Joce, who's 
mostly trying to block Caleb out, tells KL to lay off → Caleb: "Yeah, 
why are you being so *mean* to me, Kayla? You should listen to your *girlfriend*~" KL: "She is NOT my—!"
	- It's a stock gag, I know. The intention is that Kay Lin is more infuriated, like Caleb just killed her dog, than embarrassed—though the latter sets in when Joce gets up anyway.
- When Caleb falls, his clothes dissolve with him. Minor detail: the pendant is not included, as Kay Lin breaks the necklace chain when she slices his neck. She glances down briefly before approaching Joce.
- Kay Lin is usually fairly expressive. For that last part, she's blank.

## 5
The first part of this installment flickers between the third challenge and brief snippets of the events between last installment and now. For ease of summarizing I'll just go chronologically:

After being frozen in that position for what felt like forever, the Beacon summons went off, and Kay Lin stepped back as if nothing had ever happened. There was no trace of Caleb. Kay Lin tried to talk a bit but Joce barely responded. They split on the way to the Beacon, though Joce constantly felt like she was being watched (a sense echoed during the challenge, although there, it's true).

The challenge splits players into two groups for a silent, uninterrupted capture-the-flag-type game—though instead of grabbing an item, the target is something to destroy. Players also tag each other via laser/jab to the neck.

Joce perceives much of this like a first-person shooter, although it seems less like she's having *fun* and more like this is a much-needed outlet to lose herself in. At one point she thinks she sees Kay Lin blocking her and nearly freezes, but it's "nameless" (the lookalike) and she pushes through. Towards the end, the actual Kay Lin is threatened but victory is in Joce's reach; she chooses victory, and the challenge ends as Gary shoves Kay Lin over.

The challenge prize is messages in bottles, letters from home; Joce neglects hers. As the adrenaline wears off, Gary congratulates her on a challenge well-won and invites her back to the house; she thinks it's a trap and resists, but Gary points out her exhaustion, and Joce relents. She crashes on the first bed she can find.

When Joce wakes up, her prize bottle is on the nightstand, along with a note from the accountant. Elsewhere in the house, Kay Lin is conversing casually with others, and noticeably bruised where Joce hit her last night; she doesn't maintain eye contact with Joce or vice versa.

Joce attempts to talk to people both to get a read on the situation and potentially make new allies, but it's a self-fulfilling spiral: she's not used to regular conversation, and the more tense she is the more erratic her behavior. Additionally, while Kay Lin hasn't accused her of anything, people have drawn their own conclusions.

When Joce sees Gary talking to Kay Lin and looking sympathetic, Joce panics. She tells Gary that she *is* responsible for the bruise but (for unrelated reasons) there's more to Kay Lin than meets the eye; however, Joce is unable to elaborate Gary asks if he can tell the accountant (no) and Joce notices people listening (oh *fuck* no).

Joce could use a drink, but goes to the next-best thing: the accountant's study. The accountant is puzzling over a map and is apparently impressed by Joce's input, which Joce appreciates. Gary steps in, apparently to ask the accountant about something; the accountant immediately recognizes this is about Kay Lin, which she takes as confirmation Kay Lin killed Caleb. The agreed punishment for breaking the house rule is simply getting kicked out, but the accountant excitedly thinks they need to revisit that; Gary apologizes for the trouble and asks Joce to wait outside.

Kay Lin is still halfheartedly entertaining chatter when Joce interrupts: they need to leave, *now*. The people Joce tried talking to earlier are wary if not antagonistic, and Kay Lin doesn't defend her; however, Gary pulls the duo aside. He admits he doesn't care what they did, but the accountant does, so he's going to send them off before this blows up. Before they go, Kay Lin asks for Joce's bottle; Joce insists she doesn't want it, but the accountant (who of course followed) hands it over. With that, Joce and Kay Lin get the hell out of dodge—albeit not particularly in sync.

### also of note
- Joce isn't a professional at the challenge or anything, but Gary's crew is mostly hungover.
- Three people left the house last night, two came back. Joce is first to bring this up when she rejects Gary's invitation, and there's no denial of the fact thereafter from anyone.
- Note attached to Joce's prize-bottle: "Someone's looking out for you ;) (P.S. Meet me in my study. You know where it is. —the accountant)"
- The accountant calls Joce a genius for recognizing that the world map is a loop; walking to one end just takes you back to the "opposite" side (hence Joce's confusion at the Beacon in part 2).
- Regarding murder-consequences, Joce says "Don't hurt her." The accountant makes no promises.

## 6
The two are not happy. Joce admits she sold Kay Lin out, but she tried to leave *before* Gary and the accountant could catch up because she cares, and that's a confession. Kay Lin, however, accuses Joce of having a savior complex, only dragging her (KL) along to feel better about herself. Joce asks what the hell Kay Lin was doing last night; Kay Lin eventually admits she was trying to provoke Joce, because she doesn't understand why Joce never fights back—or why Joce has stuck with her in general. Joce can sympathize with the final sentiment.

A rabbit or two interrupts the moment, but Joce and Kay Lin finally get to put their old technique into practice and it's awesome. They find shelter underground and all seems well, but Joce remains irked by the bottle and is reluctant to talk about it.

Come nightfall, Joce sneaks out to toss the whole thing to oblivion, but hesitates. Gary shows up, having been concerned all day (and, implicitly, frustrated with the accountant). Joce admits the letter is from... someone she does not like, and she thinks she knows what it says but can't bring herself to toss it without reading. Gary suggests she just read it, get it confirmed and over with.

Where Joce expects a sorry pity party begging for her back, she gets a scathing indictment from someone who feels abandoned, suicidal, and personally slighted. Sal blames her for their life having gotten worse since she left, declares intentions to die, thank you for nothing, go to hell.

Joce is incensed. Rabbits have closed in on her and Gary, and despite a semi-coordinated effort, Joce triggers a cave-in to kill the last one—and Gary is taken down in the process.

Kay Lin finds Joce standing despondently in the wreckage. She wades through the flood and wordlessly takes Joce's hand.

### also of note
- KL: "I don't understand why you never fight back. You could've, I dunno, shoved him back or thrown me off—" J: "Did you *want* to get stabbed?" KL: "Yes. *No!*"
- Towards the end of the argument, after the mutual understanding that neither Joce nor Kay Lin get why the other hasn't left for good yet, Kay Lin offers a reconciliatory handshake: "Here's to being fucked up." Joce's reply is that she would prefer not to be, but she accepts the motion.
- Standing over the melting rabbit(s), Joce wonders aloud if they're *all* people like the first to fall, or if the dead usually fade like Caleb. At the end, Gary is buried in a pool of rubble.

## 7
This episode and the next are interspersed with flashbacks, not necessarily in chronological order. I'm gonna skip that for now and [stick it between these sections](#78-flashbacks). TL;DR Sal was the ambigous clingy-rotty-melty person from Joce's alcoholic overwhelm, and their relationship was... A Lot.



- meanwhile injury + BSOD = Joce unresponsive
- Kay Lin meets Sequitur x2, gets high
- interim framed in cheating parallel
- x3, accountant blackmails
	- mostly threatens Joce but has pendant
- zombie!Gary attacks, Joce OUT
	- hint: being stuck here changes you

## 7--8 flashbacks
(There's no reason for the tense switches here. They just Happened. That said, some of these bleed more into the present-day sequences than others.)

1. When Joce was young and tried to tell a not-quite-friend about the impending end of the world, she got frustrated and chucked a ball over the fence—smashing glass, setting off someone's car alarm. Sal was on standby, smoking and apparently not bothered; they were more interested in Joce's stuttering, mumbled apology, and her subsequent frustrations with her peers not *getting* it. Sal had a nihilistic outlook, too; Joce was both repulsed and intrigued. As an authority dragged her off, the car's owner (apparently Sal's date) returned, infuriated with Sal.
1. Through adolescence, Sal left Joce notes, and they met over private smoke breaks. She expressed ongoing frustration with authority, the system, the works; Sal commiserated, called her smart for seeing through it all, but encouraged her to finish high school. Then she'd look responsible, and when she turned 18 and the social workers were dying to offhand her, she could move in with Sal. Apparently their latest s/o had left them, just like they all did. Despite general abrasiveness and continuing to call them a weird-ass creep, Joce is sympathetic.
1. Days in Sal's shitty little abode bled into each other. It was them against the world, and if that meant rotting together, so be it. Many a night was spent jeering at whatever was on TV, varying degrees of drunk. While watching a soap in which the hero physically backstabs his love interest (Sal saw it coming from a season away, *ugh*), Sal suggests on a whim: "Let's get married. For tax benefits." Joce, already more drunk than they were, throws up.
	- It's unclear whether Sal ever went through with this. Joce is never seen with a ring, though in the next few segments she seems to have scratched that finger raw.
1. It's late. ("Unholy hour of the morning, maybe almost sunrise" late.) Joce stares blankly at the game over screen of a first-person shooter. When the door opens she comes to life; hey, that group is back in town— There are poorly-muffled makeout noises. Sal has brought someone home, and Joce is left standing blankly in the doorway.
	- "Don't mind her. She knows what she signed up for." "You *bastard~*"
1. All the ravishment in the world (between more *incidents,* of course, to keep things interesting) cannot snap Joce out of a dissociative trance. Sal gets tired of trying. Really, what did she expect?
1. One day Joce was actually leaving the house. Doctor's appointment. Sal almost speaks up, and Joce waits for anything. Instead they grumble about big pharma, and Joce slams the door behind her.  
It's daytime. Then it's not. Joce returns to a locked door. Key's useless. She backs away, trips on the steps—
1. —which parallel-cuts to her nearly slipping off the edge of a bridge. She catches herself; the rain is torrential. A flickering sign catches her attention: an advertisement for a movie in her favorite gritty action movie franchise. Now playing.

Pieces of the franchise also feature in snippets 1 and 2 through Joce's outfits, and 4 through her game; it's also the source of the poster in her room. I don't know what the series is called and its story is barely shown, but as a bonus detail: it's cliché as fuck, about an anti-hero tough guy with washes-hands-too-often-itis (what Hollywood calls OCD). In the specific movie of interest, antihero toughguy faces down against his Evil™ Temptress™ ex-wife. It is a sexist dumpster fire and Joce adores it.
