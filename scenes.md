a sentence a scene keeps the text wall awayeah it really doesn't but I can try

Part divisions are subject to change, especially around the middle, but for the sake of scope I would really like to not break 12. That said, lengths vary.

## 1
- tentative title: "Relapse"

Players wake in a panopticon-esque underground, and are welcomed to the game: many have entered, one will win, and the winner can go home.

Joce lives a mundane, predictable life in one room of a shared house, and has incessant intrusive thoughts of imminent disaster. (It's usually background noise.) But thanks to both a mild sprain that refuses to wear off and quarantine driving everyone battier than usual, the predictability feels stifling. In this context Joce receives two letters: one from "Salvador," which is shoved in a drawer full of unopened letters from the same sender, and an invitation to the thrill of a lifetime.

Back in the underground, one player has taken it upon herself to rally the others; Joce isn't interested. When the grandstander picks out someone much smaller, however, Joce takes notice. She approaches the nearest person with food, intimidates them, and offers the morsel to the girl in the corner.

Joce "stands guard," internally monologues/zones out about the world being harsh and the strong needing to look after the less fortunate, and then the girl asks what Joce is doing. Thus introduces Kay Lin, who is neither a child (claims she went to medical school, or was going to) nor withdrawn as Joce anticipated. Joce introduces herself by name without thinking and immediately regrets it.

The talk is interrupted by the underground flooding, which spurs the first challenge: escape, and the only way out is up—and crowding fast. Joce has a good grip until the first person falls, at which point she starts internally panicking. Kay Lin U-turns to reach out, after which they help each other up to the end.

Unfortunately Kay Lin's act incurred a penalty: while the other survivors gather supplies and weapons (baseball bats), Joce and Kay Lin get jack shit. Joce decides not to stick around; the "camera" lingers on a hand, rotted white, rising from the deep.

That central zone was below the Beacon, a huge structure resembling the red North arrow of a compass. Joce intends to trek to the boundaries of the landscape alone, but Kay Lin stays close. Their banter is interrupted by what sounds like someone screaming and/or crying, which Joce investigates despite Kay Lin's hesitance.

The wailing echoes out from a crevice; it's a rabbit, which attacks Joce on sight and swiftly overpowers her. Joce is faced with a "game over" screen, with two options: give up, continue. Though rattled, she doesn't want to abandon Kay Lin, and hits the latter option. It procures a small drink.

Joce wakes to find the rabbit has been dispatched and is half-melted through the ground; when she tries to lift the jaw for a closer look, it drips molten through her fingers. Upon seeing Kay Lin did this (blasting the rabbit with that ambiguous fluid, which is apparently *in* the rocks), Joce asks how she knew; Kay Lin admits she's too familiar with this place, but isn't sure why she's here.

As the sky darkens, Joce decides to keep Kay Lin around; that familiarity makes her simultaneously a valuable ally and a dangerous enemy. And on the basest level, Joce still feels the need to keep her safe—even though, if the game is whittling down the competition down to one, it can't last. Is she being played for a fool? If it means sticking to her guns, does she care?

### also of note
- In the background of the challenge, there's an exchange like "Come on, Terry!" "Who?" "Gary!"
- The first person to fall is distinguished by some kind of necklace. The same accessory is strangling the rabbit.
- Minor detail: after Joce wakes up from the "game over," she has a small ring of white-rot around the base of one finger. But since she wears gloves (and has all sorts of miscellaneous hand scratches), it's barely noticeable.
- Full disclaimer, I do not know how the little guys trigger the rock-blast-thing yet. But they do. They have their ways.

### post-credits? bonus? start of next installment??
Back at the Beacon base, the grandstander, Addison, has kept a sizable group around. (A timid boy she helped during the challenge, Caleb, stays especially close.) The figure that rotted hand belonged to, henceforth dubbed "White Rabbit" (WR; she *is* mostly human, though), approaches; WR doesn't talk, but indicates she wants to join the group. When Addison hesitates, WR takes a bat and smashes down a nearby structure, blasting a rabbit no one noticed was there.

No one's protesting after that.

- From the supply-gathering on, Addison has a slightly different outfit. It includes a necklace with an eight-pointed star pendant, which doesn't seem to be part of the usual handouts.

## 2
Over the first night, WR helped allies set up camp. Addison pulled her aside and, admitting to little faith in her own leadership or the alliance's longevity, proposed a "true" alliance.

The next day, Joce sets out on a straight path away from the Beacon, continuing her trek; she and Kay Lin troubleshoot a means of rabbit-blasting, but the journey is thankfully quiet.

Meanwhile, Addison struggles to keep up with everything going on with everyone, which is obviously something she must do; she gets fed up, rounds up three of the tough guys (WR included), and decides to scope out the land, grab more supplies. (Caleb insists on joining, too.)

Back at the Beacon, Addison's party finds Joce and Kay Lin puzzling over a map. Addison reintroduces herself, clearly interested in getting Joce on her side, but again Joce is unimpressed. Rabbits are spotted outside, which splits Addison and Joce from the group; Addison tries to propose similar to Joce as she did to WR, but Joce tells her off. Joce escapes with Kay Lin and one of Addison's "guards" is killed in the fray.

Returning to the alliance, the non-WR surviving guard, "Wolf," churns a rumor mill around Addison's incompetence, while only Caleb tries defending her. Addison tries an explanation/apology talk of dubious genuity, which mostly makes things worse.

That night Addison ventures underground, seemingly in hopes of finding something big or important that will make everyone love her again. (Probably following up on something she noticed back during the Beacon attack?) Caleb follows her down, and though they have a nice talk at first, Caleb insists on bringing her back. Frustrated, Addison sets something off (inadvertently? intentionally? intentionally, but worse than anticipated?), and the space collapses.

The Beacon summons players back with an ear-splitting alarm and a minor earthquake. Joce notices Caleb is alone; when the instructions begin, he cries louder, announcing that Addison is dead.

### also of note
- Maaaybe instead of randomly finding the pendant earlier, it's down here, and moving it is what sets things off? Idk. This part's still a lil fuzzy, but there *are* some kind of controls down here.
- Joce is confused by the map because she walked away in a straight line and found the Beacon right back in front of her. This will be explicitly confirmed later (if it hasn't been already), but basically: the landscape loops, like a small warped globe.

Thanks to Caleb it takes some fumbling for everyone to get the hang of what they're supposed to be doing, but for summary's sake: In the second challegne, players are divided into smaller groups of ~5, one of whom is a designated outlier. Going solely based on talk and one clue, non-outliers have to determine and vote out the oddity; the oddity simply has to be the last of two standing. The winner(s) advance to the next physical level for a prize at the peak; losers don't have to die this time.

Game one, round one: Joce and Kay Lin are grouped with Caleb, Wolf, and a fifth. Caleb accuses Joce of basically-murder for throwing Addison off yesterday; Kay Lin points out that's irrelevant to the challenge, turns the ever-aggressive Wolf on him, and thus Caleb is unanimously voted out. (Not the outlier.)  
Round two: Joce is called out for not saying much, tries to question Wolf, and regrets it immediately; Kay Lin interjects and swings the spotlight over to the fifth, who tries to defend but slips up. They're the outlier, game over.

Between challenge-games, Kay Lin asks Joce why Joce didn't scapegoat her. Joce can't answer before the next round begins.

Game two: Joce is grouped with the person who was teaming up with Gary during the challenge. (This person hasn't given a name yet, but for summary's sake I'll prematurely use what she *will* call herself: "the accountant.") They inadvertently team up, Joce following the accountant's lead, as they're both innocent and the accountant has a very sharp memory. Despite the easy victory, Joce is unsettled.

Game three: Joce is the outlier. She quickly determines she cannot lie for shit and folds.

Lingering at base, Caleb is still trying to convince people Joce is evil incarnate. Gary steps up to invite anyone who wants a break from the drama to join him at his place; only house rule is *no murder*. Unwilling to face the alliance's scrutiny, Joce joins them (and Kay Lin, as always, tags along).

At the house, Joce encourages Kay Lin to go socialize/see if anyone's on to them, while Joce investigates the place solo. Much of it is eerily empty, but at one point she gets overambitious, falls, and reaggravates the sprain. Kay Lin finds her, reports that no one cares, and tries to get close, spiking Joce's paranoia. The accountant interrupts to announce drinks are being served, with the unspoken implication attendance is mandatory.

### also of note
- The fifth person in the first challenge-game, referred to in the cast as "[nameless]({%include url.html%}/cast#nameless)," looks vaguely similar to Kay Lin. Background people aren't generally visually defined, so the similarity could just come down to having long straight hair or something. They're not related. But it's intentional.
- There's probably some kind of character dynamic echo in the others from the second game, too. Haven't defined that yet.
- Yeah, I need to figure out the house layout and exactly what Joce gets tripped up by here.
- Did I mention this part hasn't been super fleshed-out yet?
