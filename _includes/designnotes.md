Hex color codes and height measurements need not be precise; they're provided anyway for consistency. **Relative** colors (value + hue) and heights (where one character stands proportional to another) are more important.

Similarly, while some design details are key (for characterization and/or thematic reasons), others are a byproduct of art style; for instance, black and white are used fairly deliberately, but hair is often exaggerated for silhouette. There are also aspects where the distinction between diegesis and stylization is besides the point.

- **<span class="x">Important: </span>Notes in bold should be maintained for recognizability.**
- <span class="ni"><span class="x">Less important: </span>Notes in gray are stylistic decisions on my part, and aren't strictly necessary.</span>
- Notes without either format are neither vital nor trivial, take ’em or leave ’em.
