Since January 2021, I've been ending each month with a wall of art that wouldn't have been posted otherwise; mostly sketches and doodles of varying completion, and some works-in-progress of things that *did* get posted.

Originals are [on deviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/gallery/81345929/compilation-stuff); these versions have non-story-related content cropped and/or faded out. None are captioned; apologies for the inconvenience.

<!--note to self: anything with J+KL takes thumbnail priority, but something finished/in full color would be nice. barring that, a somehow-representative sketch that DOESN'T include J/KL. no text ideal-->
