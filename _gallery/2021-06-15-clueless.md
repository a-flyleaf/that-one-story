  Two panels resembling shots of a film.
  - In the first, Joce looks down offscreen, mildly surprised; text pointing at her reads “monologues at a thousand miles a minute.”
  - In the second shot, Kay Lin has a blank smile. Indicates the text: “clueless”

Needlessly overworked joke doodle, because I liked a couple frames from this dialogue test storyboard-thing:

{%include youtube.html url="es60m_QcKQ0" desc="<p>A rough animatic featuring Joce and Kay Lin; no audio. Dialogue appears in speech bubbles like a comic.</p><p>Establishing shot: They walk through a hilly landscape. Dissolve to Joce from the front. A speech bubble appears, a dragged-out <i>“so”—</i>Joce looks to the side, and Kay Lin (the speaker) steps out from behind her.</p><p>Joce looks down. Asks Kay Lin, “Where’re we going next?”</p><p>Joce rolls her eyes. Her reply is rapid, all words smushed into one: “First of all there is no <em>‘we’</em>.” She emphasizes this with small hand movements. “Second, even if there <em>was</em> a ‘we’, we—”</p><p>She stops. The camera pans down to Kay Lin smiling blankly.</p><p>Quiet ellipses. Dot. Dot. Dot.</p><p>Joce sighs. More slowly: “You didn’t understand a word I said, did you.”</p><p>Replies Kay Lin: “Nnnnot in the <em>slightest!</em>” She offers a thumbs up. The scene fades; end video.</p>"%}
