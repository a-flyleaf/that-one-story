caption: "<p>A multi-page comic of an entire scene, with context.</p>
	<h2>page 1: Previously on [this stil needs a title] (much abridged)</h2>
		<ul><li>In a bleak place resembling a multilevel colosseum, text reads “<strong style='font-weight:normal; text-transform:uppercase;'>Rise & shine, last one standing <u>wins</u>. Winner can go home, GLHF</strong>”</li>
		<li>The third speaks: “<strong style='font-weight:normal; text-transform:uppercase;'>K so, headcount.</strong> I would like <strong>everyone</strong> to answer bc I am <strong>good</strong> and <strong>important</strong>. / Talking to you too btw”: The first character, sitting in the corner of one cavern, thinking <i>Yeah right. I don’t answer to <strong>posers</strong>.</i></li>
		<li>Continuing, the third: “<strong style='font-weight:normal; text-transform:uppercase;'>OK fine be that way. HBU, small person.</strong>” (It’s the second, who the crowd proceeds to stare at.) “<strong style='font-weight:normal; text-transform:uppercase;'>Hello???</strong>” Dialogue continues but the panel cuts back to the first, who’s also noticed. “<strong style='font-weight:normal; text-transform:uppercase;'>God</strong> what are you people <strong style='font-weight:normal; text-transform:uppercase;'>deaf</strong>. <em style='text-transform:uppercase;'>Anyway—</em>”</li>
		<li>The seventh has found an apple. “oh boy. food. lucky me.” Then the first towers over them. “uhhh. may i help you”</li></ul>
	<h2>page 2</h2>
		<ul><li>The apple has been left by the small person, who’s still sitting in the corner; knees up, arms crossed, head down. From offscreen, upward: “Hey.”</li>
		<li>Small person looks over. Then up. Not moving.</li>
		<li>The first leans against the wall across from her. Internally monologuing: <i>That’s right. It’s all yours now.</i></li>
		<li>She’s not looking at the small person anymore. <i>The world is cruel. If we can protect ourselves, we can look out for the less fortunate. It’s the least we can do</i> Abrupt spoken interruption: “What are you doing?”</li></ul>
	<h2>page 3</h2>
		<ul><li>The first is startled. “I am, uh, s-standing guard.” “Why?” “In case someone tries t. to steal that.”</li>
		<li>Small person glances outside.</li>
		<li>Looks less reserved now. “I… don’t think anyone cares.”<br/>The first sits across from her, still wary, still stuttering: “That’s what you think. You never know.”</li>
		<li><i>They could be faking ignorance,</i> the first thinks. <i>Something could explode. Someone could snap—<em style='text-transform:uppercase;'>you</em> could snap. If you’re not careful, you could</i> and the letters turn to flicking static.</li>
		<li>“Why don’t <em style='text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;'>you</em> eat it?” asks the second, holding out the apple. Joce is, again, startled: “<strong style='text-transform:uppercase; font-weight:bold;'>Wait what no.</strong>”</li>
		<li>The small person is now kneeled right by the first’s feet, still holding the apple (but not like it’s precious); “What, you think it’s inedible?” Joce: “<strong style='text-transform:uppercase; font-weight:bold;'>I eat one granola bar a day.</strong> F-For breakfast.” Making zero eye contact. “That’s all I need.”</li>
		<li>Muses the second: “It only takes weeks to starve to death.” Joce tries to get a few words in: “Aren’t you a little <em>young</em> to—” Small person continues, unphased: “Well, give or take, but infection would probably kill first—”</li>
		<li>Asks the first, “How do you know all this?”<br/>Replies the small person, who looks like a bandaged street orphan: “Oh, I’m a med student.”</li>
		<li>The first stares at her, slack-jawed.<br/>“<span style='letter-spacing:.15em;'>Yeaaah</span>,” the girl says, “I get that a lot.”</li></ul>
	<h2>page 4</h2>
		<ul><li>“Well, okay, I was <em>going</em> to— long story haha <em>aaaaaaaanyway,</em>” and she interrupts the first’s stupor with an extended hand, “<strong style='text transform:uppercase; font-weight:normal;'>Hi</strong>, what’s your name?”</li>
		<li>“Uh.” A pause.</li>
		<li>“Joce.” Handshake taken.</li>
		<li>“Nice to meet you, ‘uh-Joce’~” “I-it’s just ‘Joce.’” “And mine’s Kay Lin—” declares the second, who has to take Joce’s hand with both of hers, “two-word first name, ’k?” Joce isn’t making eye contact. “…Mhm.”</li>
		<li><i>This can’t last.</i></li></ul>
	<p>Space for a facing page has been left intentionally blank.</p>"

[Second go]({%include url.html%}/gallery/bruh) at a comic scene. The apple was an on-the-spot decision (it could be any food, really) but otherwise the scene has barely changed since [February]({%include url.html%}/gallery/roundups/2021-02).
