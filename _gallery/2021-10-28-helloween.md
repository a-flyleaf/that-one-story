caption: "<p>A picture of the gang, nearly all of whom are dressed in costume, sitting or standing around a table. Little labels and speech bubbles trail around them.</p>
	<ul><li>The first is just wearing a cardboard box on her head, details scribbled on with marker. Label: “made it herself 6 hours ago”</li>
	<li>The second has a cape and fangs. The first is talking with her: “I’m Radiohead.” “Isn’t that a TV?” “Close enough.” “Can you even <em>see</em> through that thing?” “No.”</li>
	<li>The third, as labeled, “showed up without a costume (and is feeling kinda stupid about it now),” because everyone else has a costume. The seventh makes an offering: “wanna borrow a sheet?” Third, quietly: “Ew, no.”</li>
	<li>The fourth, dressed as an angel, is spooked by the fifth, who’s grabbing for him playfully. Fourth is about to spill his drink on the second.</li>
	<li>In the back, the sixth, in a lab coat and goggles, holds the photo-taking button, offering a dry “smile” for the camera. (No one else seems aware a photo is being taken.) She and <s>Frankenstein</s> the fifth are labeled “somehow got roped into matching costumes”</li>
	<li>The seventh is a bedsheet ghost; it’s not the whitest bedsheet. Seven, as labeled, “was helping her [the eighth, a baseball batter] and ran out of time for their own getup”</li></ul>"

Halloween costumes. [Again]({%include url.html%}/gallery/sleepover), the characterization is canon enough; the scenario is very much not.

Also has an alternate version, because "these designs are not made for flat colors" [strikes again]({%include url.html%}/gallery/batta).
