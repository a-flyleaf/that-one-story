caption: "<p>Portraits in parallel of a younger first character and a shorter-haired second, both grabbing a hand extending from the viewer’s perspective.</p>
	<ul><li>First is grabbing the hand by the wrist. “<span style='text-transform:uppercase;'>You think you can change my life,</span>” reads the speech bubble, “<span style='text-transform:uppercase;'>and get away with it?</span>”</li>
	<li>“<span style='text-transform:uppercase;'><b>Hell no!</b></span>” reads the background of the second. Then, written on the extended arm: “<span style='text-transform:uppercase;'>Live with your mistake</span>”</li></ul>"
