  A colorful grid of expressive (mostly-)three-fourths views, titled "expressions." and captioned "reactions to dialogue with no context". Dialogue prompts go down a column; each person responds in a row.
  - "**Congratulations!**"
    - Joce glances aside, uncertain. "...F-for what."
    - Kay Lin waves it off. "Pshh, *nah*, it was nothing---"
    - Addison looks all smug about it. "Heh, of course--- I mean thank you!"
    - Caleb throws his arms up excitedly. "Y--*Yeah*!! I did it!!!"
    - Gary throws an arm around a (mostly-offscreen) teammate, pointing to them with a smile. "Wasn't just me, man."
    - The accountant stands, arms crossed behind her back as usual, grinning a bit. "Touching. Flattery will get you nowhere with me."
    - Sequitur turns around; they "[have] no idea" what this is about. "Uhh. Thanks...?"
    - The eighth person (henceforth "8") stares into space, unsure if this is a joke. No dialogue.
    - The ninth person (henceforth "9") seems faintly interested. "...No shit? What for."
  - "**Sorry for your loss.**"
    - Joce, turned away, is despondent.
    - Kay Lin is crying, but manages a shaky "Thank you..."
    - Addison looks down. "Y-yeah. Thanks."
    - Caleb is curled up (the "camera" looking down on him, as if he's sitting on the floor), bawling inconsolably.
    - Gary, reaching out, wipes an eye. "Thanks, dude. You got a tissue?"
    - The accountant, turned away, is frowning. "Mhm. ...Change of topic:"
    - Sequitur's head is bowed. "...â€™preciate it."
    - 8 is turned away, stiff. No dialogue.
    - 9's arms are crossed. "Aww, how cute. You think I cared."
  - "<strong style="text-transform:uppercase;">Hey! Fuck you!</strong>"
    - Joce lifts her chin, clearly miffed but saying nothing.
    - Kay Lin yells back: "What is your <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">problem?!</em>"
    - Addison is stunned/offended; wordless exclamation.
    - Caleb also yells, more forward: "W-well <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">fuck you</em> too!!!!"
    - Gary steps back, hands raised; "<em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">**Whoa** whoa whoa---</em> calm down---"
    - The accountant is utterly unphased. "How original."
    - Sequitur jerks back, pointing at themself a little. *Um.*
    - 8's back is turned entirely; does not engage.
    - 9 glances off to the speaker, unamused. "F\*ck me yourself, coward." And when there's implicitly no response: "... Yeah, what's what I thought. [muttering] Asswipe."
  - "**I love you.**"
    - Joce is just about speechless. "N. No you don't."
    - Kay Lin blushes, stunned. Then turns away, raising a hand by her face; "Come on, that's not funny."
    - Addison: ". . . Oh! Yeah, uh---cool?" She isn't sure what to make of this. "Good for. Good for you...!"
    - Caleb is speechless, staring directly into the speaker's eyes. He's unsure if this is a prank or if he will now die for you.
    - Gary offers a ðŸ¤Ÿ and smiles all happy. "Aww, thanks! You too, bro."
    - The accountant brings a hand to her heart but her expression is utterly dry. "Thank you. I am so touched, and overflowing with inconvenient emotions."
    - Sequitur is wholly baffled. "...*h?*" (Alternatively, they say "Awwww *shucks*. ...for real??", but I thought the version drawn was funnier.)
    - 8 looks down. "<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Ha ha ha ha. Oh man.</span>" Then stares directly ahead. "<em style="text-transform:uppercase;">I am so sorry.</em>"
    - 9 does a chinhand but looks irritated. "Oh, I *bet* you do."
  - **[getting jumpscared]**
    - Joce is surprised, then runs; <strong style="font-weight:normal;text-transform:uppercase;">#Nope.</strong>
    - Kay Lin jerks back, startled.
    - Addison ducks on sight.
    - Caleb screams, hiding himself best he can while still standing.
    - Gary raises his hands, in a similar gesture to the anger response.
    - The accountant is visibly surprised, but like Kay Lin it's not pronounced.
    - Sequitur covers their face a bit; they have an incredibly slow reaction time.
    - 8 raises a fist, as if ready to fight back.
    - 9 appears mildly surprised, but doesn't stay that way for long. "Well, *that* might as well happen." A rabbitlike shadow looms.
