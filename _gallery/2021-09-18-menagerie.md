Early concepts for delightful critters. Inspirations noted from <a href="https://off.fandom.com/wiki/Dedan" class="ext"><i>OFF</i> (Dedan)</a> and <a href="https://steven-universe.fandom.com/wiki/Alexandrite?file=Super_Watermelon_Island_111.png" class="ext"><i>Steven Universe</i> (Alexandrite)</a>. (While not shown here or in other sketches, I was also inspired vaguely by <a href="https://thewaltenarchives.fandom.com/wiki/Bon?file=Bonkillrose.jpg" class="ext"><i>The Walten Files</i></a>.)
