caption: "<p>All eight characters on a height chart, except the eighth is a sketch. Written title: “~character design is my passion~”, subtitle “and all that jazz”. Additional notes:</p>
	<ul><li>“*exact hex codes don’t matter, sketch is showing On Purpose™”</li>
	<li>[continuing] “mostly because I didn’t know what to do with these two [the last two characters]. RIP”</li>
	<li>Seventh character has a sketch with a much more slouched posture; “good pose but use this [pointing to the finished ref]”</li>
	<li>“idk you [eighth person, who is standing there blankly] well enough for a Good Pose (yet)”</li></ul>"

First go at a proper <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/swiftgold/art/blank-height-chart-121670324" class="ext">height chart</a>. (Note that, although exact numerical measurements have been deprecated in favor of relative heights only, these are still more or less accurate.) Still wasn't happy with design #8.

There were also a couple alternate versions, which weren't included because it looked weird with only two characters appearing multiple times:

{%include figure.html subcat="gallery" picture="" img="2021-04-alts" class="pic" alt="" caption="<details><summary>image description</summary><ul>
	<li>artist note: “these aren’t Intentionally together, I just don’t know what the others’ alt. outfits (if any) are yet”</li>
	<li>Second character has shorter hair, dark brown eyes, and modern clothing. Small note next to colorful rubber-band-bracelets on both wrists: “hues + amount of these don’t matter”</li>
	<li>Third character has a jacket, belt, and boots.</li>
	<li>Both are smiling.</li></ul></details>"%}
