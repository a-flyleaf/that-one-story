caption: "<p>An assortment of drawings featuring the fifth and sixth characters. They stand together in the center: “It ain’t <em>that</em> deep—” says the fifth, but insists the sixth, “Oh, but it <em style='text-transform:uppercase;'>is</em>—”</p>
	<ul><li>Top left doodle: 6 reclines in a tub (labeled “S.S. Borked Perspective”), spilling a cocktail with a gesture in one hand, the other on a phone which she is not amused by. Saying “[>5000-word essay about someone being Objectively Wrong™]”</li>
	<li>Bottom left: The two stand side by side, exchanging a Look. Fifth’s arms are crossed; he looks uncertain, like, a silent “yeesh.”</li>
	<li>Right: “Selfie” of the fifth by a window, a rabbit-monster just outside. Captioned “nature is healing 😄😄😄😂🐇💀💀”</li></ul>"
