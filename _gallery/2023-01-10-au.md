  Title poster for "untitled AU thing," and three standalone drawings used to advertise its updates.
  - In the poster, a dark castle and a lurking rabbit loom behind the gang (Joce, Addison, Gary, and Sequitur), standing uncertainly in the foreground. Kay Lin sits in a tree off to the side; in smaller details, there's a silhouette in a castle window, and a tall figure stands behind the side tree.
  - In the first update-art, Addison, Gary, Joce, and Kay Lin stand in the rain, all holding umbrellas. Kay Lin doesn't have a reflection, and the same figure stands silhouetted in the woods behind them.
  - In the second update-art, Addison ("a perfectly normal and sane human being") tries to pull away Joce ([long string of question marks]), who turns back towards "sickos" (vampire!Caleb in a window, Kay Lin silhouetted in the foreground).
  - In the third and final update-art, which riffs on the UI of a dating sim, Kay Lin speaks to Joce: "Heyyyyy wanna go out and get a bite? Get it, *bite,* because I kinda want to taste your blood and watch the light drain from your eyes until you become an abomination [text goes out of the bubble and is partially cropped out] to god just like me... haha jk." Joce, banging on the edge of the canvas in a panic, has three options: <strong style="font-weight:normal; text-transform:uppercase;">[Run]</strong>, <strong style="font-weight:normal; text-transform:uppercase;">*[run]*<span class="x"> (italicized,)</span></strong> (which is selected) and <strong style="font-weight:normal; text-transform:uppercase;">"Unless"?!??!</strong>
