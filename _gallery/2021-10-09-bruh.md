caption: "<p>Two-page comic scene in which the first and fifth characters interact amicably.</p>
	<ul><li>The first, Joce, stands outside a crowd, wary; abruptly the fifth yells, pushing through, “<span style='text-transform:uppercase;'><b>Hey</b> hey hey, put ’er here!!</span>” He raises his fist.</li>
	<li>Joce stares blankly.<br/>Red dude gestures instructively.<br/>Joce: “<span style='text-transform:uppercase;'>Oh</span> right, yeah, uh—”</li>
	<li>As instructed, she offers a fistbump. Red guy swings back, enthusiastic; “<i>Eyyyyyy</i>”</li>
	<li>“Yo, you were <span style='text-transform:uppercase;'>boss</span> at that challenge. You are welcome <span style='text-transform:uppercase;'>right</span> back to <em>me caysa</em>” (<i>“Casa,”</i> interrupts the sixth, from a distance in the crowd) “any time.” Red dude’s arms are oustretched, welcoming, but the crowd is starting to fade into static.</li>
	<li>Red dude, continuing: “and if anyone try’a give you shit about last night, you just call yer ol’ pal <span style='text-transform:uppercase;'>Gary</span>. Ya goddat?” For unclear reasons he appears to be enveloped by static.</li>
	<li>Joce taps her fingers quickly and the effect vanishes.</li>
	<li>“Uh, yeah. Sure.” Gary’s already walking away. “Thanks.. Gary.”</li></ul>"

[Another]({%include url.html%}/gallery/jaundice) comic test, this time ft. an actual canonical scene. (Sort of. Changes have been made since.)
