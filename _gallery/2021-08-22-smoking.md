caption: "A character with black and white hair stands in a faded holographic haze, smoking. The smoke itself is drawn as psychedelic text: “i’m walking on the road like i’m alive / they say that love is fictional / maybe it’s all your fault”. Stray, misaligned text to the side finishes the lyrics: “<span style='text-transform:uppercase; letter-spacing:.15em;'>You don’t want the likes of me</span>”"
