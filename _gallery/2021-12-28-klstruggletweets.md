caption: "<p>A series of loosely-connected two-panel comic strips, altogether titled “some silly stuff from 2AM last night”. All feature Kay Lin (KL) and her yellow eyes.</p>
	<ul><li>First strip: Second character (KL) follows the first (J), humming the song <i>Turn around, bright eyes</i>. J: “You’re the one with glowstick irises.” KL: <i>“‘Glowstick’?”</i></li>
	<li>Second strip: Third character (A): “All right, listen up, Goldie—” [KL interrupts:] “‘Goldie’?? Where did <em>that</em> come from?” A: “What would you prefer, <i>“‘Starving Child’”</i>?” KL: “My <em>name</em> is an opti— <em>neither of those words are true</em>”</li>
	<li>Third strip: Sixth character crouches in front of KL, who’s tied to something. TA: “All right, what’s up with the yellow irises?” KL: “Bold question from someone with bright green… blue… cyan… aqua…? char…treuse…?” TA: “Take your time.” KL: “What do <em style='text-transform:uppercase; font-style:normal'>you</em> call th[em]” TA interrupts: “Wouldn’t <em>you</em> like to know.” (The hue of TA’s irises is inscrutable, like the rest of her.</li>
	<li>Fourth strip: Seventh character (Sq) declares, “Jaundice. I maintain my first assessment.” KL, sitting by: “Y’know what, I’m too f’d up to even argue.” Sq: “Woof.”</li></ul>
	<p>In a bonus single panel, third person (Caleb) passes Kay Lin, who’s face-down at a table, fists clenched. “Whoa-a-a,” says Caleb, snickering, “not lookin’ too hot there, are ya, <strong>egg yolk</strong>?”</p><p>Caption: “In that moment Caleb signed his death warrant.”</p>"

Side note: eye color is not a thing that is commented on canonically, but it would be funny if it was.

Vaguely-relatedly, a comment thread spawned <a href="https://sta.sh/0269qvjw1xe5" class="ext">a bonus</a>.
