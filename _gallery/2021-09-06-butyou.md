Title partially alludes to a former title consideration, <i>No one else but you</i>.

Bonus banner version, because I like how the lines turned out but think they got a bit lost with color:

{%include figure.html subcat="gallery" picture="" img="2021-09-06-banner" alt="Closeup of the drawing, colors adjusted to make line contrast clear."%}
