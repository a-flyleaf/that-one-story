You're about to view **a full <a href="https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/192/2575" target="_blank">colorscript</a>** to the entire story as it stood in August 2021. Elements may or may not have remained since; might make sense out of context, might not. I provide no further commentary.

**<a href="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/gallery/2021-08-colorscript.png" target="_blank">"I don't care, show me the spoilerage!"</a>** (opens the full image in a new tab/window)
