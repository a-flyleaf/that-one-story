Three entire drawings related to the thing, from before it was a thing.<!--more-->

The title's a bit of a misnomer; I have a whopping three (3) images for this post, and one of them's from *years* ago. This is literally it before 2021, though, so without further ado:

These first two technically have nothing to do with the story, but the designs were roughly recycled for the main two characters.

The actual story didn't exist until November 30, 2020, and at this point it was just a random throwaway idea that I toyed with for a day and moved on from.

About a month later I revisited my notes, thought it was cool, and it spiraled from there.

	img="2020-12-30"
	alt="color disaster in my head"
	caption="I don’t have the slightest idea what the ‘S’ stands for, or why… any of these color/design choices are what they are, really. I think I <em>did</em> want the protag to have not-straight hair though, because few of my characters do/did and it would be good incentive to practice. Besides that… big/small, tough/meek, that’s it that is Literally it"
