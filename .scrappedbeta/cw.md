In no particular order, and probably not comprehensive. Numbers in \[brackets] refer to the specific part(s) of relevance.

General boxes ticked: swearing, violence (drawn, not realistic), substance use, and suggestive themes (nothing explicit).

## overall
**Recurring themes** of codependency, substance abuse & addiction, unhealthy sexuality, suicide & ideation thereof, and all-around trauma in the context of romantic/peer-to-peer relationships.

- People get stabbed onscreen and there's blood, but no additional gore.
- Body horror, <span class="spoiler">including explicit human-monster transformations,</span> courtesy rabbits.
- Multiple scenes of drinking or equivalent.
- No one gets naked and there are no direct references to sex. That said, see section below.
- Overt references to suicide and wanting to die. Occurs twice, alluded to directly another two times (at least); two of these instances (one each) are a **major** story spoiler.
	- occurrences: <span class="spoiler">\[9] Em in a flashback; \[11] Joce at the end (on a surface level)</span>
	- direct allusions, not shown: <span class="spoiler">\[7--8] Joce on a bridge for no otherwise-apparent reason in a flashback; \[general] heavily implied to be how Kay Lin died in the previous game)</span>
	- Entire story spoiler: <span class="spoiler">This is basically the crux of Kay Lin's motivations.</span>

## implied but not explicit
- parental abuse; passing implication <span class="spoiler">(Joce's home life is heavily implied to be hot garbage)</span>
- sexual coercion, dub/noncon; suggested in three scenes, from most to least textual:
	- <span class="spoiler">\[4 & 7--8] vague, uncomfortable flashbacks between Joce and Sal</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">\[7] Kay Lin and Sequitur's encounters are somewhere in this territory, with \[10] the last one being most intense (and threatening on a purely textual level)</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">\[7--8] you can certainly *read* the kidnapping scenario in this way, though it's not intended by the characters</span>
- memory decay <span class="spoiler">(the rabbit-transformation has psychological effects loosely akin to dementia)</span>

## other
Details and plot points of varying significance that people might find unsavory.

- an intimate relationship in which characters meet when one is an adult and the other is a young teenager; the relationship is problematic for numerous reasons, but the age gap is not explicitly condemned
	- relationship is primarily shown in <span class="spoiler">\[7--8], with a brief vague scene in \[3]</span>
- people who look noticeably young in violent and/or suggestive scenarios (Caleb and Kay Lin; thanks to the latter, see above for specifics)
- the general idea of rotting alive; <span class="spoiler">depicted literally, albeit not realistically, courtesy art style</span>
- animal death, besides the rabbit-monsters; <span class="spoiler">(one scene in \[9] centers on a snared rabbit)</span>
