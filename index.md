**[synopsis]({%include url.html%}/synopsis)**: Three versions of a story summary: a sentence, a paragraph, and a general storyline. Includes a footnote about my goals with the story.

**[cast]({%include url.html%}/cast)**: Short character descriptions; details that wouldn't necessarily be discernible otherwise.

**[scenes]({%include url.html%}/scenes)**: A much longer version of the story, laying out each scene and additional notes of relevance.

## content note
The story has been built around the allure of a mutually-destructive relationship, so jot that down,,

## miscellaneous meta-musings
- the big title thought as of Dec.14 is *You're gonna be the death of me*. also considering *No one else but you*, but that sounds too much like something that'd be in all-caps bold italic arial on an aesthetic post when the tone I'm thinking of is more "serious storyline, but Has Humor"
- first got the idea in late November 2020, developed for 2--3 months around January--March 2021, dropped it for a while, and then it came back with a fucking *vengeance* when I thought of a major twist in mid-May (I think?) and now we are in it *deep* my dudes
