Website/art archive for <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/gallery?q=%23unmooredrandos" target="_blank">the untitled project-thing I've been working on for over a year now</a>. Expect links to break as I figure out what the heck to do with it.

## Who're you?
<a href="https://a-flyleaf.github.io" target="_blank">a-flyleaf</a>, hobby artist and story-wrangler.

## What's this about?
> A twitchy survivalist-wannabe warily teams up with a suspiciously-careless girl in a thrilling, destructive hellscape.

It's a hammy little story, envisioned as a 12-part series. I am not sure I have the dedication to make it a full comic start to finish (<a href="https://a-flyleaf.github.io/blog/project-rambling#now-what" target="_blank">more rambling on that here</a>), but I've been playing around with the story long enough to draw out some scenes, and so here they are.

Also, deviantArt's layout sucks, so I wanted to compile things on my own gosh dang website.

## What can I expect from this?
In the meta-storytelling sense: *I don't know I'm making it up as I go.* Copious "concept art" and other doodles for sure. Little comics for actual scenes. Written description to an extent, maybe.

For the actual story: **it's not for kids**. No explicit gore or nudity, but contains adult themes. Author has chosen not to use more specific warnings.

Spoilers abound, but because of the winged and possibly-achronological nature of the storytelling, this is rarely noted. When I think something warrants spoiler coverage, it'll be grayed out <span class="spoiler">like this</span>. On a computer you can click and drag to read it. On a touchscreen or other device... uh, not sure, I'll figure something out.
