## in a sentence
A twitchy survivalist-wannabe warily teams up with a suspiciously-carless girl in a thrilling, destructive hellscape.

## in a paragraph
When twitchy survivalist-wannabe Joce wakes up in a competition where only the winner goes home, she takes pity on and hesitantly teams up with a dubiously-careless girl, Kay Lin, who seems to know too much. In the game's thrilling, destructive hellscape, the duo are forced to confront warped monsters from the shadows, the all-too-familiar frustrations of fellow players, and inevitably each other. Maybe the only way to win is not to play.

## by part
tentatively titling the first part "relapse" and the last "you can't save her," no idea for the rest
