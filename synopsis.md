## in a sentence
A twitchy survivalist-wannabe warily teams up with a suspiciously-carless girl in a thrilling, destructive hellscape.

## in a paragraph
When twitchy survivalist-wannabe Joce wakes up in a competition where only the winner goes home, she takes pity on and hesitantly teams up with a dubiously-careless girl, Kay Lin, who seems to know too much. In the game's thrilling, destructive hellscape, the duo are forced to confront warped monsters from the shadows, the all-too-familiar frustrations of fellow players, and inevitably each other. Maybe the only way to win is not to play.

## general storyline
In a barren, looping expanse punctuated by abstracted stone structures, streams of ambiguous liquid, and the wails of underground rabbit-monsters, Joce takes pity on fellow outcast Kay Lin. Thus begins a mutually-enabling teamup in which Joce is never quite sure if she's the protector or being strung along, as Kay Lin's own motives for staying close remain frustratingly ambiguous.

**Spoilers for everything below.**

Along the way the duo is challenged (and mirrored) by three other pairs:
- Joce rejects the faux bravado of would-be alliance leader Addison, and Kay Lin kills Addison's whiniest, clingiest follower Caleb.
- Intentional simpleton Gary tries his best to lend a hand, but his insistence things will be easy leads to his demise. Later, his deceptive partner "the accountant" forces a confession out of Kay Lin by threatening Joce, playing both their motives against them.
- Sequitur doesn't care much about anything, and is all too happy to let Kay Lin spiral with themâ€”until she tries to use their passivity against them. Meanwhile, although Joce initially gets along well with new alliance leader "White Rabbit," WR's own desire to "save" her companions proves just as mutually-detrimental as Joce's.

Eventually, Joce vows to get Kay Lin out of this place. Unlike most players, who upon "death" are presented with a choice to either give up or try again, Kay Lin blacks out and wakes up in a new game. The first time she played, she and her girlfriend Em made it to the end, and they agreed to a suicide pact when Em could no longer stand the daily slog. But when Kay Lin's eyes were closed, Em jumped off the Beacon (the tallest structure around, the only clear directional) to her apparent death.

Throughout the story, it becomes clear that people who choose to stay, even (especially) if it kills them again and again, are warped beyond recognition: they turn into the rabbit-monsters, keening beasts of emptiness and paranoia. Additionally, those who win under normal circumstances are simply presented with the same simple "persist/quit" choice as anyone else.

Kay Lin's ultimate motive only becomes clear towards the end: because Joce has much in common with Em, she hopes goading Joce to finish the job will finally grant her release (if not in actuality, then as a twisted "peace of mind"). However, Joce refuses to repeat old patterns of mutual self-destruction. She disarms Kay Lin, then steps back off the Beacon herself. (Spoiler alert: WR is Em, who's locked herself in on purpose. She didn't want to deal with the very real ramifications of leaving Kay Lin, and is heavily implied to have a hand in Kay Lin's inability to leave.)

The narrative is bookended by letters from (at the beginning, alongside the game invitation) and to (in an "open" letter that remains intentionally unsent) Joce's ex-s/o Sal. They met when Joce was young, bonded quickly and intensely over shared nihilistic worldviews, and vowed to rot together. Once Joce moved in with Sal, she grew frustratingly lethargic; eventually Sal started bringing newer, more exciting people home. At the start of the story Joce thinks she's over it all; it becomes very clear, about midway through, that she's kidding herself. In the letter she writes back at the end, she's trying to move on.

## meta-rationale footnote
The whole story is something of an extended character study. I care less about diegetic explanations and more about whether the events and mechanics make sense as reflections of character psyche.

In-story, this means you won't have people explicitly wondering about, say, why there are hellrabbits or how anyone wound up here in the first place. That said, there's probably a few aspects that stick out unintentionally; for instance, I'm still trying to figure out how the game & challenge instruction-delivery actually works, and the exact *thing* that triggers diegetic setting-destruction.
