Not incluing tiny fixes or single art additions.

- Dates are in year-month-day format; "1/11"&nbsp;= January&nbsp;11, *not* November&nbsp;1.  
- Note that some pages mentioned here may not be linked anywhere; as the site grows haphazardly (organically?), sometimes there's stuff I want to make but don't quite have a place for yet. It gets made anyway; navigation comes later.<!--consider linking the sitemap here, and/or in the footer... after Actually figuring out the nav-->

## "beta" site
The site was initially intended to be a story outline for beta readers, with the idea that notes on separate pages were less annoying to cross-reference (and less intimidating to be presented with) than a linear document.

- 2021/12/12: created site; initial scene+cast notes
- 2021/12/13–14: scene writeups v1
- 2021/12/16–19: scene writeups v2
- 2021/12/23: "beta" site housekeeping
- 2022/01/10: layout reconfiguration; added gallery
- 2022/01/11: finished adding art; <b>published site</b>

Did not actually end up recruiting beta readers, so the site turned into a glorified gallery.

- 2022/08/11: new index image; backend gallery shuffling (including catch-all page)
- 2022/08/11--12: gallery pages & navigation overhaul; colorscript info page
- 2022/08/14: simpler gallery navigation; colorscript layout tweaks (caption functionality, single-row layout)
	- <small>(accidentally pushed a bunch of changes from this day, whoops. They were supposed to be on my end only until I'd completely overhauled the site.... >_>\")</small>
- 2022/08/25: gallery page tweaks & cast catch-all page

The original idea was that I'd finish the entire colorscript, first to last episode, then revamp the site and publish everything in one go. Instead I finished *one* colorscript, forged ahead with site updates anyway, and then the aforementioned accidental publication happened.

Back to incremental publication, then...!

- 2022/09/10: actually made v1.2 layout
